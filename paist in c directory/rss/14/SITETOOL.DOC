Introduction: 
   SITETOOL.EXE is a TOOL to convert Site Files from "older" MaxTrac LS RSS 
Version R01.00.00 to a "new" format recognized by Version R02.00.00.
If you have not created Site Files with the R01.00.00 Version you do not
need to use this program.

SITETOOL Use:
    The RSS for the LTR Trunking Radios, MTX-LS (newly released Portable) 
R01.00.00 and the MaxTrac LS (Mobile) R02.00.00 are to share Site Files. 
To accomplish this several changes have been made in the Site File format 
of the RSS.  Note the Site Database File(s) MAXT_LSI.DBF are no longer 
used by these new RSS releases.  For your "older" Site Files to be 
readable by the "new" RSS's they must be converted by SITETOOL.EXE.  
SITETOOL will automatically save the file with the current date of 
conversion.  Please note that SITETOOL is used only for the 800 Mhz radio 
as the 900 Mhz radio is not available at this time.   

WARNING: !!!!!!!!
         You are STRONGLY ADVISED to perform a complete DOS backup
         of all Site Files and MAXT_LSI.DBF file(s) prior to performing
         this procedure. Note that converted Site Files will not be 
         readable to the "older" RSS version.  Also, the name of the 
         source Site File and the target file cannot be the same. 
         The RSS default directory for saving Site Files is 
         C:\mrss\maxtls\site.

SITETOOL is installed in the directory C:\mrss\maxtls. It is recommended 
that you copy SITETOOL.EXE from this directory into your Site File directory.
To use the tool, type SITETOOL with the required arguments at the DOS
prompt.  Listed below are the definitions of these arguments.
         
Syntax
     SITETOOL  argument_1  argument_2  [argument_3] [argument_4]

Parameters
    argument_1 : [drive:][path] filename
                 Specifies the location and filename of the original
                 (source) Site File to be converted.

    argument_2 : [drive:][path] filename
                 Specifies the destination of the converted (target) Site 
                 File.

    argument_3 : [number]
                 This is the Site Number which will be saved in the
                 target Site File. Allowable values are from 1 to 255. 
                 If this argument is not given, the value defaults to "001". 
                 *See Note.

    argument_4 : [number]
                 This is the Site Version which will be saved in the 
                 target Site File. Allowable values are from 1 to 255.
                 If this argument is not given, the value defaults to "001". 
                 *See Note.

NOTE: The new RSS's will create Site Files with the following convention. 
The filename default is "SITE_num.ver" where "num" and "ver" are the values 
used from arguments 3 and 4.  To be consistent with this naming convention 
supply arguments 3 and 4 appropriately.  If these arguments are not given, 
both values default to "001".  These values can be edited later from within 
the RSS.



  Example:

SITETOOL C:\mrss\maxls\site\site0001.001 C:\mrss\maxls\site\site_001.255 001 255

If SITETOOL.EXE has been copied into your Site File directory as recommended,
the pathname can be eliminated as shown below:

SITETOOL site0001.001 site_001.255 001 255



Converted Site Files Number and Version values can only be from 1 to 255. 
If any of your old Site Files began with the number zero then you can 
increase the target Site File number and version by one.

Helpful Hints:     
     Since only one Site File at a time can be converted, it is useful
to create a DOS batch file to run multiple conversions.  

EXAMPLE: 
         FILENAME: SITE.BAT

         sitetool site0001.001 site_001.001 001 > site_001.dat
         sitetool site0002.001 site_002.001 002 > site_002.dat

      In this example, the Site Number argument is given and each Version 
is defaulted to "001".  The use of ">" redirects the output for later 
viewing.  Refer to your DOS manual or DOS on-line help for further
explanation of batch files and redirection.
