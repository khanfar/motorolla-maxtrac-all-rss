   DOS / PC (Troubleshooting) Setup Checklist
   ==================================================================

   If you are having difficulty running RSS products on newer PCs -or-
   Laptop PCs, especially older versions of the RSS products, the tips
   below may help you.  We strongly suggest trying these items
   -PRIOR- to calling Motorola Customer Service for aid.

   Because PCs and DOS are rapidly changing and expanding their
   architectures, it may not be possible for older RSS versions to
   successfully run on the latest machines.  If these tips don't work
   for your old versions, we suggest contacting Motorola Americas Parts
   Division for an RSS upgrade.  If you have the latest version and
   still have problems after trying these tips, please contact Motorola
   Customer Service.

   The items below are suggested as a starting place.  You must consult
   your manufacturer's manuals for details on how to access your CMOS
   setup, and other PC-specific operations.  Your DOS manual must be
   consulted for DOS version-specific information.  Also, consult the
   README.TXT file on the RSS installation disk for the most current RSS
   information.

   ================
   (-A-)  VERIFY RIB, CABLES and SETUP are OK - Using your older PC, verify
   that the RIB, CABLE and Radio setup is working correctly.  After this
   step, move the PC-to-RIB cable from your original PC to you new PC's
   Comm. Port, remembering that the Comm. Port number (COM1 or COM2)
   may be different. See RSS Manual for Comm. Port selection and the
   "COMMUNICATIONS TEST" function.

   If no older PC is available, try changing the RIB, CABLES and Radio to
   verify proper hardware operation; also, ensure proper Comm. Port selection.

   ================
   (-B-)  MEMORY - Modern PCs and DOS can support four types of memory;

       (1) CONVENTIONAL - The lowest 640 KB of memory address space. This
       is the primary memory of all PCs.  Those RSS products that do
       -not- use EXTENDED memory need as much of this space as possible.

       (2) UPPER - The next-highest 384 KB memory address space. 
       Application programs normally cannot access this memory.  This space
       contains VIDEO/DISPLAY and other device data.  It also can be used to
       load certain device drivers "HIGH", to free-up some CONVENTIONAL
       memory.  !! CAUTION !! Some driver programs do not run in the UPPER
       memory area. On 80386 (and above) PCs, access to UPPER memory requires
       use of the EMM386.EXE memory manager.

       (3) EXTENDED/HIGH - Together, CONVENTIONAL and UPPER memory take up
       the first 1 MB of memory.  EXTENDED memory is all memory above the
       1 MB address.  The HIGH memory area is actually the first 64K of
       EXTENDED memory space.  Loading DOS "HIGH" puts most of DOS in this
       HIGH area.  On 80286 (and above) PCs, the EXTENDED/HIGH memory can be
       accessed using an extended memory manager such as HIMEM.SYS.  Many
       RSS products require EXTENDED memory.

       (4) EXPANDED - This type of memory is not directly accessable to
       programs.  It normally was installed using an expanded-memory board,
       and required an expanded-memory manager to "map" the physical memory
       into the program's address space.  Today, EXPANDED memory can be
       "emulated" by managers such as EMM386.EXE, which use EXTENDED memory
       to emulate the expanded-memory card.  EMM386.EXE can also be used
       to load certain device drivers "HIGH", into the UPPER memory.

   Memory management begins with statements placed in the CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  Memory configuration should ideally
   maximize the amount of CONVENTIONAL and EXTENDED memory available, by
   using HIMEM.SYS and loading "DOS=HIGH" (in CONFIG.SYS).

   To repeat for clarity, loading DOS "HIGH" actually puts DOS into the
   HIGH portion of EXTENDED memory.  Loading device drivers "HIGH" puts
   them into the UPPER memory area (requires EMM386.EXE).  Both techniques
   can be used to free-up CONVENTIONAL memory, if needed.

   !! NOTE !! The DOS 5.x/6.x command "MEM /C | MORE" can be used to profile
   your memory configuration, and monitor changes in memory allocation when
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are changed.

   RSS products do -NOT- require EXPANDED memory, and if EMM386.EXE is
   used for either EXPANDED -or- UPPER memory access, enough EXTENDED
   memory must be left free for RSS allocation.  Consult the RSS User's
   Guide or the README.TXT file on the RSS installation disk to
   determine how much EXTENDED memory is required.

   Additional CONVENTIONAL memory can be freed by using EMM386.EXE to
   load selected device drivers into the UPPER area, using the "ram"
   switch (see DOS "HELP EMM386.EXE").  The "noems" switch can prevent
   some RSS products from executing properly.

   ================
   (-C-)  CONFIG.SYS - As part of your troubleshooting, remember that
   DOS does NOT require CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to be present at
   startup.  When these two files are absent, this gives you a "clean
   start" (e.g. -NO- conflicting drivers, and -NO- "Terminate, Stay
   Memory Resident" (TSR) programs). Any RSS -not- requiring EXTENDED
   memory should be able to run with -no- CONFIG.SYS / AUTOEXEC.BAT.

   !! CAUTION !! There are some PC "security" programs that don't allow
   the CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT files to be missing or altered. 
   Check with your PC System Administrator if this is the case.

   !! CAUTION !! For ultimate safety, create a "bootable" floppy
   diskette, using the DOS "FORMAT /S" command, and copy your original
   CONFIG.SYS / AUTOEXEC.BAT files to the formatted floppy diskette.

   Do NOT delete your original CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files; instead,
   rename them (DOS "REN" command) to CONFIG.001 and AUTOEXEC.001.  Then,
   later, you can "COPY" them back to the standard names, and edit them
   for changes.

   For PCs with EXTENDED memory, the following -minimal- CONFIG.SYS
   should work for -all- RSS products, and HIMEM.SYS is REQUIRED for RSS
   products that need EXTENDED memory;

       DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS /V
       DOS=HIGH
       BUFFERS=20
       FILES=20
       STACKS=9,512

   !! CAUTION !! It is (Microsoft) recommended practice to always load
   HIMEM.SYS as the  -1st-  line of the CONFIG.SYS;   -IF-   EMM386.EXE
   is used, it should be the  -2nd-  line, with "DOS=HIGH,UMB" as the 
   -3rd-  line.  ALWAYS put the "memory manager" entries -prior- to the
   "memory user" entries.  Reversing them may appear to work, but is not
   a stable configuration.  HIMEM should be -prior- to EMM386.

   If this minimal CONFIG.SYS (with -NO- AUTOEXEC.BAT) enables your RSS
   execution, then add back one line at a time, remembering that each
   line could affect memory allocation, and could cause conflicts with
   other resource managers/users.  Use DOS 5.x/6.x "MEM /C | MORE" to view
   memory area allocation, as you make changes.

   Do the same with AUTOEXEC.BAT, putting back one line at a time, to
   identify / isolate problem configurations.

   Some drivers/utilities to watch for in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT;

       1)  The DOS "SHARE" Program causes problems with some RSS products.
       2)  The DOS "GRAPHICS" Program causes problems with some RSS products.
       3)  The DOS "EMM386" Expanded Memory Mgr. "noems" switch can conflict
           with some RSS products.
       4)  The DOS "POWER.EXE Program can interfere with some LapTop power
           management systems (see below).

   ================
   (-D-)  CMOS SETUP - Most modern PCs have CPU speed selection and "caching"
   options as part of their CMOS setup.  To begin your troubleshooting,
   set CPU to the lowest possible speed, and turn -all- cache (internal
   and external) off.  Both the high speed and caching can interfere
   with timing when reading/writing the Radio through the RIB box.

   ================
   (-E-)  POWER MANAGEMENT - LAPTOPS (and some newer desktops as well) have
   power management features to conserve operating power. The interrupt
   used in this process cannot be turned off by applications, and
   typically takes a -long- time to service the various devices, and
   this can interfere with timing when reading/writing the Radio through
   the RIB box.  Turn the power management OFF, or to the least-active
   mode allowed.

   There are some PC manufacturers who are advising that the Microsoft
   POWER.EXE driver be REMOVED from the CONFIG.SYS file, because it may
   interfere with the PC's internal power management functions.  Consult
   your manufacturer's literature.

   ================
   (-F-)  8250/16450/16550 Communications Port UARTs - The 16550 UART
   (Universal Async. Receive/Transmit) is functionally equivalent to
   the 8250 and 16450 UARTs, with the addition of 16-byte XMIT/RECV
   FIFO buffers.  To conserve power and chip count, many manufacturers
   are using custom-ICs to -emulate- the 16550 UART.  Some emulations
   are variants, such as powering up with the FIFO enabled (a true 16550
   powers up with FIFO -disabled-).

   The symptom would be repeated errors while trying to READ/WRITE the
   Radio Codeplug via the RIB box.

   Some manufacturers are supplying a utility program that allows the
   user to -disable- the FIFOs, for backwards compatibility.  For
   example, COMPAQ supplies "COMFIFO.EXE" (c) for their "Contura Aero (c)"
   series.  Consult your manufacturer's literature and/or THEIR Customer
   Service.


   ==================================================================
   SECTION (2)

   CAUTIONS When Using FLOPPY DISKETTES for Archiving Codeplugs
   ==================================================================

   If you are using FLOPPY DISKETTES for archiving your codeplug files,
   please keep the following in mind;

   A)  Due to ambiguities in the (extended) error codes returned to an
   RSS from DOS/BIOS (See "DOS Extended Error Codes" below), the RSS
   cannot always properly report the precise nature of an error while
   reading/writing disk files.

   One example is using an UN-FORMATTED Floppy Diskette.  The DOS error
   code returned is "31", "GENERAL FAILURE" (type unknown).  This type
   of failure usually is interpreted by the RSS as an "immediate exit"
   situation, because the error could be from other resources, such as
   your -fixed- disk, and continuing could jeapordize your system/data.

   B)  Due to (A) above, you should ensure that -all- your diskettes are NEW
   and PROPERLY FORMATTED prior to using them for codeplug archives.

   C)  Floppy diskettes and -drives- are exposed to DIRT and MOISTURE.  Keep
   your diskettes in their sleeves and away from contaminants. Clean your
   -drives- periodically with commercially-available cleaning kits.

   D)  You should check the condition of your floppy diskettes PERIODICALLY,
   by running DOS "CHKDSK (A: -or- B:)" or (DOS 6.x) "SCANDISK (A: -or- B:)".
   If these DOS programs detect problems, even if "corrected", we recommend
   copying that diskette to a NEWLY FORMATTED diskette before continuing,
   and using the NEW diskette for future archiving.

   If problems persist, the diskette may be defective, -or- your -drive-
   may need cleaning or repair.

   E)  Using a floppy diskette that is ALMOST FULL can cause problems,
   such as not leaving enough room for renamed backups (the old version
   stays and the new version is added), not enough room for the next RSS
   database entry (into the *.DBF file), etc.  After each RSS session,
   perform a DOS "DIR (A:  -or- B:)"; the last entry of the report tells
   how many bytes are "free" on the diskette.  We recommend leaving at
   least 10,000 bytes free at all times.

   F)  An alternative to floppy diskettes is re-organizing the archive
   system on your -FIXED- disk.  The RSS allows multiple CODEPLUG or
   ARCHIVE subdirectories, under unique names, such that each sub-dir. can
   be organized by model number, customer, department, etc.  Create the
   sub-dirs. via DOS "mkdir -name-" command.  Then access each sub-dir.
   from the RSS using the "(F2) Change Archive" on the GET or SAVE screen.

   This offers the advantages of greater speed in finding files and in
   reading / writing files, much quicker access to various archives
   without changing diskettes, and higher limits on how many files can
   be in a single archive.

   These archives need periodic BACKUP to floppy diskettes (or -tapes-).
   Make sure you save -all- files in the archive sub-dir., to include some
   RSS "database" files (*.DBF).  Large sets of archive files can be backed
   up to floppy diskettes via "compression" programs that create "*.zip"
   files.  !! CAUTION !! The first file you should save to a compressed
   backup diskette is the version-matching "uncompress/unzip" program file.


   ==================================================================
   SECTION (3)

   "Sorting" Codeplug-File Directory Entries, for Faster Finding
   ==================================================================

   Many RSS programs were not designed to "sort" the file entries in a
   codeplug archive into an "ascending" number order, by serial number.
   Quickly finding a particular serial number from 100+ entries can be a
   problem. There are utilities available that can sort directory entries
   into ascending number order, making it easier to find particular serial
   numbers.

   One such utility is Peter Norton's (c) "DS" (Directory Sort, Version
   4.50).  It will read directory entries, sort them by several
   different user-chosen orders, and re-write the directory entries
   permanently in the new order.

   Another method is the DOS Version 6.x "DEFRAG" command, similar to
   Peter Norton's (c) "SPEEDISK" (Version 5.0);  both offer an option to
   sort files into ascending order while de-fragmenting your disk files.

   All of the above (and others) can be used on both -fixed- and -floppy-
   disk archive directories.  Please read the appropriate documents carefully.
   !! CAUTION !! Always backup your disk(ette) -prior- to first use of
   these utilities.


   ==================================================================
   SECTION (4)

   DOS Extended Error Codes
   ==================================================================

   The RSS Program is an application program that must use the PC's DOS
   (Disk Operating System) and BIOS Interfaces for access to computer
   resources such as memory, disk drives, disk files, printers,
   communication ports (e.g.  COM1), etc.

   If the RSS performs an operation on a resource, and DOS/BIOS detects an
   error, DOS will return an error code to the RSS.  This will most
   often (but not always) be reported in the form;

       Error Code          - nn    Gives Specific Error Information
       Error Class         - xx    Gives General Situation Information
       Locus               - yy    Gives General Source (Device) of Error
       Recommended Action  - zz    Gives Recommended (Recovery) Action

   In some cases, only the Error Code is shown.

   To aid users in resolving problems with computer resources, the
   following list of DOS Error Codes is given.  These Codes are commonly
   documented elsewhere as "DOS Extended Error Codes", under INT 59(hex)
   "GET EXTENDED ERROR INFORMATION".  Also shown are the CLASS and LOCUS
   Codes.

   The ACTION Codes are not shown.  The RSS has limited options to take
   any system-level "recovery action" without jeapordizing your data or
   your system. Some Codes are ambiguous.  Each new version of DOS can
   expand the number of defined Error Codes and/or expand the current
   definitions.  Also, various VERSIONS of DOS/BIOS can return different
   Codes, depending on their implementation.  E.g., a common return for
   attempting access to an un-formatted floppy disk is (CODE-CLASS-LOCUS)
   31-13-2 "GENERAL FAILURE",  not the possible  11-9-2  or  26-11-2.

   No representation is made that this list is complete or accurate.  Further
   information on the codes and terms shown below can be found in
   commonly-available DOS references.  Using the three Codes together may
   help you to find/correct any resource problems you are having.

   The Codes are shown as DECIMAL values.
