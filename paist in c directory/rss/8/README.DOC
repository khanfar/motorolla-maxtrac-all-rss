       The Motorola -- MaxTracùLS LTR Trunking -- Radio Service Software,
       RVN-4139, has been updated as follows;

       Part #......................... RVN-4139-A
            includes 3.5" installation diskette
            RSS User's Manual #....... 68P8-1078C79    

       Software Version............... R01.00.00
       Software Date.................. 06-MAY-95

  1. - The SITE Sub-Directory is now the DEFAULT storage for SITE FILES.

  2. - !! IMPORTANT !!  The STACK size of this RSS has been increased,
       to enhance stability in a normal DOS environment (this does NOT affect
       execution memory requirements).  If your environment includes elements
       which create abnormal quantities of hardware/software interrupts, then
       we STRONGLY recommend the following statement be inserted into your
       CONFIG.SYS file (DOS 5.x/6.x):

                          STACKS=8,512

       This tells DOS to furnish stack space to hardware interrupts which
       occur during RSS execution, thereby reducing the RSS stack loading, and
       avoiding errant DOS/application behaviours.  This statement WILL reduce
       the amount of conventional memory available by approximately 4 Kb.

  3. - The RSS CodePlug ARCHIVE and SITE File -BACKUP- default is now
       [path] Sub-Directory        [C:\MRSS\MAXLS\] BACKUP.
       For FLOPPY diskette backup, Please see Item 4-(B) below.

  4. - The Install batch file, A:HDINSTAL.BAT;

       (A) Defaults installation to Hard Drive C:\MRSS\MAXLS; you can
       edit HDINSTAL.BAT to change default drive and/or the sub-directory.

       (B) Creates sub-directory "C:\MRSS\MAXLS\BACKUP".  To backup
       on floppy diskettes, use MAIN MENU "F9 - SETUP" and "F3 - PC CONFIG"
       and enter "drive_letter:" (e.g. "A:") in the Backup field.  If
       you wish this to be the default setup, use "F8 - SAVE" to save the
       Configuration File.  Also, temporary setting can be done via the
       "F2 - CHANGE ARCHIVE" function on LOAD/SAVE sub-menus.

  5. - If you are replacing RSS HVN-9645 (Radius/M500 LTR Trunking)
       with this RSS, Please Read Appendix (-A-), below.

  6. - The INSTALLATION DISKETTE for this RSS has all files marked "Read Only"
       via the DOS command "attrib +r *.*".  It is recommended that the user
       never execute the RSS from this original diskette.  If a DOS "diskcopy"
       of the original is made, the attribute bits are also copied.  On the
       COPY, the following files should be unlocked via the DOS command
       "attrib -r <file>", before execution;
                           MAXT_LS.CFG

  7. - This RSS executes under DOS, in conventional memory (1st 640 KB memory).
       After INITIAL execution, conventional memory is dynamically allocated
       for data/file functions ( e.g. more files = more memory required ),
       and if the RSS cannot allocate enough conventional memory, an error
       message is given. Make more conventional memory available by using DOS
       "HIMEM.SYS" and "DOS=HIGH", and using DOS 5x/6x "MEM /C" to list memory
       allocations from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, removing any unnecessary
       items from those files.

  8. - Corrected RSS handling of CTRL-BRK and CTRL-C; Execution of RSS is no
       longer stopped by these keystrokes.

  9. - Communications Port (COM1 - COM2) IC (UART) now completely
       initialized upon startup.  Prevents interference from prior
       applications when communicating with Radio via the RIB.

 10. - Update to interface more reliably with the Radio on faster 386/486
       machines.  This version has Radio Bus Timing controlled by PC Timer IC.

 11. - This RSS now has no EXTERNAL OVERLAY (*.OVL) files.  This allows
       slightly faster loading and execution, and reduces execution memory
       requirements.  The RSS executable file (*.EXE) MUST be run from the
       working directory/disk, so that INTERNAL OVERLAYS can be found.
       
       To minimize hard disk space usage, use DOS command "DEL *.OVL" to delete
       the old overlay files in the installation Directory.

 12. - Warning message text now contained in new file ERRORS.DAT.

 13. - Corrected problems with HELP screen printing; 1st line of
       successive screens (after 1st) no longer blanked.

  NOTE: This RSS is NO LONGER PACKAGED on 5.25" floppy diskettes.

   Appendix (-A-);  -  Converting From RSS HVN-9645 (Radius/M500 LTR Trunking)

   You are strongly advised to perform a complete PC-DOS backup (via DOS "COPY"
   or "XCOPY" command) of ALL files in the following sub-directories, to a
   floppy diskette, BEFORE performing the below installation;

       (Drive:)\MRSS\RADMTRNK
       (Drive:)\MRSS\RADMTRNK\ARCHIVE

   The major differences between HVN-9645 and this RSS package are the default
   PATH and FILE names under the PC-DOS Operating System.  This RSS creates the
   following DEFAULT paths for normal installation:

       (Drive:)\MRSS\MAXLS         -   Main Executable/Utility Files
       (Drive:)\MRSS\MAXLS\ARCHIVE -   CODEPLUG and ARCHIVE DATABASE Files.
       (Drive:)\MRSS\MAXLS\SITE    -   SITE and ARCHIVE DATABASE Files.
       (Drive:)\MRSS\MAXLS\BACKUP  -   Default Backup Sub-Directory For -Both-
                                       CODEPLUG and SITE Files/DataBases.

   Normal installation will create all four sub-directories, and copy the Main
   Executable and Utility files from the Installation diskette.  You will need
   to copy your existing CODEPLUG, SITE and ARCHIVE DATABASE files to the new
   sub-directories, and RE-NAME the ARCHIVE DATABASE FILES.

   STEP                        ACTION / DOS COMMANDS
   ----                        ---------------------
   1) Install this RSS;        Insert Diskette in Floppy Drive (A: or B:).
                               Type "(A: or B:)", Then "HDINSTAL (C: or D:)".

   2) Go To CODEPLUG Archive;  Type "(C: or D:)", Then "CD \MRSS\MAXLS\ARCHIVE".

   3) Copy CODEPLUG FILES;     "COPY  \MRSS\RADMTRNK\ARCHIVE\A*.*".
                               "COPY  \MRSS\RADMTRNK\ARCHIVE\B*.*".

   4) Copy ARCHIVE DATABASE    "COPY  \MRSS\RADMTRNK\ARCHIVE\RADMTRNK.DBF".

   5) ReName ARCHIVE DATABASE  "REN  *.DBF  MAXT_LS.DBF".

   6) Go To SITE FILE Archive  "CD  ..\SITE".        

   7) Copy SITE FILES;         "COPY  \MRSS\RADMTRNK\ARCHIVE\SITE*.*"

   8) Copy ARCHIVE DATABASE    "COPY  \MRSS\RADMTRNK\ARCHIVE\RADMSITE.DBF".

   9) ReName ARCHIVE DATABASE  "REN  *.DBF  MAXT_LSI.DBF".


   At this point, if you wish to restore backup codeplug/site/database files
   from a floppy diskette, you can;

   10) Go To BACKUP Sub-Dir.;  "CD  ..\BACKUP".

   11) Copy backup files;      "COPY  (A: or B:)*.*".
