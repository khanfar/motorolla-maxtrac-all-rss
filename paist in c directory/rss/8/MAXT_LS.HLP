The MAIN  Menu is the top level of the program from which you  select  the
type of function that you wish to perform.  All selections are made via the
"Function  Keys", labeled (F1) thru (F10), on your keyboard. Press the
ESCape key to return to the MAIN Menu from anywhere in the program, except
that you must use (F10) to exit a HELP screen.

After  making a selection, you will be directed to similar menus and  /  or
data  entry screens for RF alignment or CodePlug data.  You must  initially
load  data from a Radio (or  disk) via the (F3) GET/SAVE function before
you will be permitted to CHANGE or VIEW any CodePlug data.

Call MOTOROLA Product Services for problems not covered in your Radio
Service Software manual or your Radio Service manual.

MAIN MENU (cont)

Function Key Descriptions:

F1 - Additional  information  is available for every menu via the (F1) HELP
     key.    Specific  HELP is also available for each field  on  all  data
     entry  screens.  Generic help is available within any HELP screen  via
     the MORE HELP function.  Use (F10) to exit the HELP screen.

F2 - SERVICE  is a multi-level menu that permits access to Radio  ALIGNMENT
     and   BOARD  REPLACEMENT  screens.   The Radio contains  no   internal
     alignment  or tuning adjustments; all alignment is performed  via  the
     SERVICE screens.
.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

     A Radio must be connected to your computer via the RIB before you will
     be  permitted  to  access the SERVICE screens.   All  SERVICE  screens
     access  the CodePlug directly; therefore, you do NOT have to read  the
     CodePlug  data (via the GET/SAVE functions) before using  the  SERVICE
     screens.

F3 - GET/SAVE is used to read CodePlug data from a Radio and/or retrieve an
     archived CodePlug File from a diskette or hard disk for editing
     purposes (via  the  CHANGE/VIEW function).  GET/SAVE is also  used  to
     program edited CodePlug data back into the Radio, create an archived
     file on a diskette (or hard disk), and to "clone" CodePlug data.
.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F4 - CHANGE/VIEW  is  a multi-level menu that is used to change,  view,  or
     modify  CodePlug  features and option  configurations.     All  Radio 
     CodePlug  parameters  are classified as either RADIO-WIDE  or  CHANNEL
     related.  CHANGE/VIEW permits access to each of these categories.

     Unlike  the  SERVICE  function, a CodePlug must be  loaded  into  your
     computer's  memory (via the GET/SAVE functions) before you can  access
     the CHANGE/VIEW screens.  You may CHANGE/VIEW a CodePlug File  without
     a Radio connected.

     configurations  and/or RF alignment settings.  A printer  is  required
     and should be connected to your computer per your instruction manual.

F6 - A FILE MAINTENANCE utility is available to create sub-directory paths,
     delete old archive files, restore archive files, and create new
     back-up files.

F7 - Not Used.

F8 - Not Used.
.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F9 - SETUP  is  used to configure your Radio Service  Software  to
     your  particular  application.   Default  disk  drives,  communication
     ports,  and  even  screen colors may be customized  to  your  specific
     needs.

F10 - Select  EXIT  to quit the program and return to  DOS.   Be  sure  all
      desired CodePlug changes have been programmed back to the Radio,  and
      that  an archive copy has been made.   Otherwise all changes will  be
      LOST, since returning to DOS erases this data from  the  computer's
      memory.

      (F10) is also used to exit HELP screens.

CHANGE/VIEW is a multi-level menu that is used to change,  view,  or modify
CodePlug features and option configurations.    All CodePlug parameters are
classified  as either RADIO-WIDE or CHANNEL related.   CHANGE/VIEW  permits
access to each of these categories.

Unlike the SERVICE function, a CodePlug must be loaded into your computer's
memory from either a Radio or a CodePlug File (via the GET/SAVE functions)
before you can access the CHANGE/VIEW screens.  You may CHANGE/VIEW a
CodePlug File without a Radio connected.
.P
CHANGE/VIEW (cont)

Warning:  CHANGE/VIEW does NOT actually modify the Radio CodePlug data, but
          instead it modifies a copy of the data retrieved from the Radio
          CodePlug or archived CodePlug File via the GET/SAVE functions.

          After  all  CHANGE/VIEW modifications  are  completed,  you  MUST
          return to the GET/SAVE menu and PROGRAM the changes back into the

CHANGE/VIEW RADIO-WIDE CONFIGURATION                                   4200

RADIO-WIDE  Configuration  is  used to  CHANGE/VIEW  Radio  parameters  and
options that affect overall Radio operation, i.e. those not just related to
a specific channel such as the time-out-timer.

Warning:  CHANGE/VIEW does NOT actually modify the Radio CodePlug data, but
          instead it modifies a copy of the data retrieved from the Radio
          CodePlug or archived CodePlug File via the GET/SAVE functions.

          After  all  CHANGE/VIEW modifications  are  completed,  you  MUST
          return to the GET/SAVE menu and PROGRAM the changes back into the

SECOND PRIORITY SCAN                                                   4204

Only  certain models of the Radio are capable of  scanning  receive
mode  frequencies.  Scanning Radios have two priority frequencies that  are
scanned  periodically  whether or not there is channel activity.   In  Mode
Slaved  Scan the first priority is the current Mode displayed when Scan  is
activated.   The  second  priority is Radio wide and  can  be  selected  or
disabled on this screen.

You  may enter the Mode Number for the desired second priority or  you  may
enter 'OFF' which will remove the second priority.  You may also use the up
and  down arrow keys to select the desired Mode.  If the Mode  is  invalid,

PRIORITY SAMPLING RATE                                                 4230

When the channel scan is stopped on a non-priority channel, it periodically
"looks back" at the priority channel for activity.  The rate at which  this
"look  back"  occurs  is  the priority sample  rate.   The  are  two  rates
available,  slow  and fast.  Slow is 1.5 seconds between "look  backs"  and
Fast is 0.5 seconds between "look backs".  Slow is the default.  To  change
the sample rate use the up and down arrow keys to select the rate.

Internal  accessories are accessories that are physically placed inside the
Radio and do not actually use the connector.  Connections are made internal
to  the Radio but still use the pin functions.  At this time there is  only
one Internal Accessory.  This is the DTMF decoder board. The decoder should
be installed in the Radio BEFORE programming. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to
either enable or disable the DTMF decoder board.

The three scan types are Normal, Revert and Search.

Revert Scan will cause the Radio to move immediately to the mode and group
which you receive a call on.  The Radio will remain on this new mode/group
until the next call is received, but will continue to scan.  This is most
appropriate for dispatcher control stations.

Search Scan will cause the Radio to lock onto the first system that it
detects a valid home channel.  If this home channel is lost for more than
three scan cycles, the Radio will begin scanning for a new system.  This
is best suited for roaming applications.
.P
SCAN HANG TIME                                                         4237

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION                                                   4291
                             !! WARNING !!

Mismatching  the Data Direction with the accessory may result in damage  to
the  Radio  or accessory or both.  Therefore,  use caution  when  selecting
functions for non standard accessories.  The direction is determined by the
selected function and is not programmable.  ALWAYS program the Radio BEFORE
connecting  a new option.  Also verify that the new option does not  exceed
the limits of the Radio's drive circuitry. In general, the limits look like
this:
                    outputs:  open collector, 200 mA amximum drive
                              with a saturation voltage of 0.3 V max.
                    inputs:   0 to 16 Volts, signals below 1.0 V logic low,
                              signals above 3.0 V are logic high.
.P
  Each  programmable  pin  has a limited number of functions  that  can  be
assigned  to  it.  Some  internal and  external  accessories  need  certain
functions  in  order  to  operate  properly.  These  functions  are  called
'dependent'  functions.  Dependent functions will NOT changed and will  get
skipped.  Remaining functions are 'independent' of specific accessories and
are  called  'independent'  functions.   "General  I/O"  with  no  internal
accessory allows the most programmable 'independent' functions.

WARNING:  Do not use the SAME 'independent' function more than once on this
          screen.  The Radio will not respond as expected to two or more of
          the same 'independent' functions.
.P
The following is a list of the available independent functions:

function: Null
  pin(s): 4,6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: The  correct  definition  for any pin which is not  being  used.

function: Tx PL Inhibit
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: An input which can inhibit the generation of PL while the  Radio
          is  transmitting.  A typical application would be 'stripping PL'
          when sending a page from an attached paging  terminal.  Normally
          this  line should be toggled prior to asserting PTT,  since  the
          Radio  will need to dekey and rekey if the line is toggled while
          transmitting.
.P
function: TOC Disable
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the Radio will disable the generation of PL reverse
          burst and DPL turn off code when a transmission ends. This can be
          useful  for some base station and phone patch  setups.

function: Tx Audio Mute
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This  input to the Radio mutes the MIC AUDIO input,  allowing an
          external  option to drive the FLAT TX AUDIO INPUT.  This is  for
          connections to paging encoders,  data terminals,  etc. To ensure
          that the transmit deviation never exceeds the legal limits,  the
          device  connected should not gate audio to FLAT TX  AUDIO  INPUT
          unless  Tx  Audio  Mute is asserted FIRST.
.P
function: RX Audio Mute
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: Used to mute the Radio when data is being received or as a high
          priority mute.

function: Special Off Hook
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: Remote monitor plus speaker enable.

  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input and the hook are OR'ed together.
.P
function: Data PTT
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: When asserted, this will make the Radio transmit with PTT IDs
          stripped, and will also not allow trunking system busy tones to
          activate.

function: External Alarm
  pin(s): 4
 purpose: An  output  which can drive a normally  open  relay.  The  relay
          connects to the vehicle horn/lights. Driven by an open collector
          transistor which saturates to A+,  with the capability to source
          200 mA.
.P
function: PL & CSQ/Trunk Detect
  pin(s): 4,8,12,14
 purpose: This output from the Radio indicates that a carrier with correct
          PL is present.

function: CSQ Detect
  pin(s): 4,8,12,14
 purpose: This  output from the Radio indicates that there is a carrier on
          the channel.

function: Clear-To-Send
  pin(s): 4,8,12,14
 purpose: This is an output used to show that the Radio is not transmitting
          and a remote device may have control for sending data.

  Debounce determines whether the Radio waits a short period of time before
acting.  This  is  done to make sure that any mechanical switch  bounce  is
accounted for.  It is only active on INPUTS. Debouncing is usually required
for  pins that are driven by relays or other mechanical devices.  Functions
that  have Debounce as "NO" should not use relays or mechanical devices  to
drive them. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to enable "Yes" or disable "No".

  Active  Level determines whether the pins will become active on either  a
high voltage or a low voltage.  Some non standard accessories may not  have
the  same active level as the default active level.  Use the Up/Down  arrow
keys to enable "High" or disable "Low".
.P
POWER UP DELAY                                                         4294

  The Radio ignores the active levels on the programmable pins during power
up.  This  is done to give the accessory device time to initialize  itself.
The time that the Radio delays is the Power Up Delay.  The default time for
this  delay  is 0.2 seconds.  If this delay needs to be  changed,  use  the
Up/Down arrow keys. This value can range from 0.0 seconds to 4.3 seconds.

The  Universal ID number is priority number assigned to the currently  dis-
played  universal  ID data. The value of the Universal ID number  may  vary
from 0 to 4 in each Access Block.  Each number indicates a priority for the
receive  ID.   Universal  ID #1 has the highest priority.  ID  #2  has  the
second  priority and so on through ID #4.  The selected group decode  range
will be the lowest priority.

The Universal ID # data is listed immediately below the Universal ID #.  If
no Universal ID numbers exist for a given access block, the  Universal  ID
data may not be accessed.  Furthermore, if no universal IDs exist, the only
valid decode for a given group selection will be the Group ID range.

.P
Busy Channel Lockout                                                   4512

  Busy  Channel Lockout may be enabled by choosing "Y".  When enabled,  the
Radio will be 'polite' to other users on the channel.  In other words,  the
Radio will not let you hear conversations of other users and will not allow
you  to transmit on top of another user.  The only calls you will hear  are
those  with  your PL code,  even if you are off hook or press  the  monitor
button.  If  you  press PTT on the Radio while there is a  carrier  on  the
channel, the Radio follows this protocol:
.P

          a. If the carrier has your PL, then you are allowed to transmit
             just like normal.

          b. If the carrier has no PL or the wrong PL, then you will hear
             a  busy  tone while you hold PTT.  Release PTT and  try  again
             later.

  If you choose "N", then the Radio will transmit and receive like a normal
two-way Radio.
.P
PHONE SIGNALLING SYSTEM                                                4513

  This  lets  you assign the phone access/deaccess code on  a  mode  basis.
Enter  here  the number of the DTMF/PHONE signalling system  that  has  the
access and deaccess code you want to use on this channel. The access  (ANI)
sequence  is  sent  when the 'select' button is pressed. If  phone  is  not
desired, do NOT assign a system here.
.P
TIME-OUT TIMER                                                        4514

If Enabled, the TOT will limit the maximum time allowed for any continuous
transmission  from 1 to 255 seconds  on all  transmit channels.  Receive
operation is not affected by the TOT.

Use the Up/Down arrow keys to select the desired time.  You will see the
display  change in one  second increments.  The range is from OFF to 255
seconds.

SITE BLOCK #                                                           4515

The Site Block Number field indicates the Site Block used for this MODE
position.  This must be a VALID Site Block/Number that has been ADDED
with the CHANGE/VIEW : SITE BLOCK screen.

A word of advice: It will be easier to

1)     CREATE/ADD all Site Files with the FILE MAINT. : SITE FILE menu.
2)     ADD all Site Blocks with the GET/SAVE : SITE BLOCK menu.
3)     ADD all Site Access Blocks via GET/SAVE : SITE ACCESS BLOCK menu.

USER SCAN TYPE                                                         4560

The three scan types are Normal, Revert and Search.

Revert Scan will cause the Radio to move immediately to the mode and group
which you receive a call on.  The Radio will remain on this new mode/group
until the next call is received, but will continue to scan.  This is most
appropriate for dispatcher control stations.

Search Scan will cause the Radio to lock onto the first system that it
detects a valid home channel.  If this home channel is lost for more than
three scan cycles, the Radio will begin scanning for a new system.  This
is best suited for roaming applications.
.P
MODE SLAVED SCAN LIST                                                  4561

This  screen displays the available modes and their scan TYPE for the  mode
display in the upper left side of the display.  The scan types are  changed
by  moving  the cursor with the Enter or Tab keys to the desired  Mode  and
changing its TYPE by using the up and down arrow keys.  Note that  Priority
One  is  always  the Mode that the current scan list is  slaved  to.   This
priority cannot be changed.

Function Key Descriptions:

F2 -  GO TO MODE allows you to go to the Mode Slaved Scan List you want  to
      modify  without  returning  to  the  MODE  CONFIGURATION  screen  and
      stepping through the modes in-between.
.P
MODE SLAVED SCAN LIST (cont)

F3 & F4  - NEXT MODE will advance the screen to the next Mode Slaved Scan
      List.  If you are at the last Mode in the Radio then pressing (F4)
      will take  you to Mode 1.  PREVIOUS MODE will return you to  the
      previous Mode.  If you are at Mode 1, pressing (F3) will take you to
      the  last Mode in the Radio.

F5 -  PRINT SCREEN will send the currently displayed Mode Slaved Scan  List
      to the printer.

F7 -  ERASE LIST will remove all of the Modes from the current scan list.

MODE UTILITY                                                           4580

The  MODE  UTILITY  screen is used for  adding,  deleting,  or  moving  the
location  (order)  of  Conventional  modes.    Modes  may  also  be  copied
(duplicated), including scan lists (Mode-Slaved only).

The (F8) (EXECUTE) function key is used to execute the  changes  once  all
information has been entered.

The  GET/SAVE functions must be used to program the changes into the Radio,
as is required for all CHANGE/VIEW modifications.
.P

.P
NEW MODE NAME (Default = Mode nn)                                      4584

Enter the 8-character alpha-numeric MODE NAME.   The Mode Name will default
to "Mode nn", where nn = mode number.  If Mode Names are disabled, you will
not be able to change this field.

Each  mode  may be assigned a Name to facilitate ease  of  operation.   The
[Mode] rocker button is used to scroll forward or backward through the list
of modes programmed in the Radio.

Since  the mode number is required for direct keypad mode selection via the
[Home] button for keypad models,  using the mode number as part of the mode
name is desirable, but not required.
.P
MODE TO COPY FROM (Default = Blank)                                    4585

Enter the Mode Number TO COPY FROM.  Any valid mode number of the same mode

DIAL SIGNALLING SYSTEM                                                 4602

This  is the  signalling system that will be used to dial phone numbers. We
made this separate  from the access  signalling system  so  that you  may
customize  things  such as dialing speed. For example, some  phone  systems
will allow faster dialing than the phone patch.

This  screen  allows  you to configure one or  more  signalling  systems.
These  signalling systems will be used by the Call List and Mode screens to
determine when and where decode or encode.
.P
ALERT TONE RESET                                                       4701

This field applies only if the Call Type is CALL ALERT or CALL ALERT with
VOICE.  This determines how the audible alert tone will be reset.  The
choice of AUTOMATIC means that the alert tone will be automatically reset
for you every 10 seconds.  The choice of MANUAL means that there will be
alert tones ONLY when the call is initially received and none thereafter.
.P
TYPE (Signalling System)                                               4702

When this screen is displayed the cursor is placed on the TYPE data  field.
There  are  six available system types.   They are;

 MDC-1200          PTTID, Radio Check, Call Alert, Voice SelCall, DOS, H/L
 STAR              PTTID
 QCII (QUIK CALL)  Call Alert, Voice SelCall, H/L Alarm  
 DTMF              PTTID, Call Alert, Call Alert/Voice, Voice SelCall, H/L
 DTMF/PHONE        Telephone Interconnect
 SINGLETONE        PTTID

NONE implies that all signalling systems in the Radio are deactivated. Use
(F8) to ADD 1st system, select system TYPE using the UP/DOWN arrow keys.
.P
ID                                                                     4703

MDC-1200 :
  MDC-1200 requires that each Radio have a unique four digit ID number. The
  default is the last four digits of the Radio serial number.  The range is
  from  0001 to DEEE.   Four zeroes will show up as "NONE";  this is useful
  when you desire the Radio to "listen only". An example of a "listen only"
  situation  might  be  a  volunteer fireman  monitoring  a  fire  dispatch
  channel.
.P
STAR :
  STAR  requires that each Radio have a unique four digit ID  number.   The
  default is the last four digits of the Radio serial number.  The range is
  from  0000 to 16383.  You may enter the ID in two ways.  The first way is
  without the tag bits added to the ID.  In this case, you will type in the
  ID that you want to have appear on the dispatcher's console  first.  Then
  on the tag bit line you will set the proper combination for the customer.
  If  the channel is only being used by one customer,  then chances are the
  tags will be 0 0. The third line shows you what the ID would look like in
  a  system  which  uses  the tag bits as  an  extension  of  the  ID.  For
  reference, the first tag bit adds 8192 to the ID and the second adds 4096
  to the ID.
.P
QCII :
  QCII ID corresponds to tones A, B, and C. It requires at least two unique
  tones.  The default is 358.6 Hz (tone A), 903.s Hz (tone B), and  0.0  Hz
  (tone C). The range is from 304.0 to 2470.0 Hz. Don't be alarmed if the
  frequency that you type in changes by a few Hertz. This change can occur
  because the program must calculate the nearest frequency that the Radio
  can understand. You will find that the error will always be within the
  acceptable industry bandwidth.

DTMF :
  DTMF  requires each Radio to have a unique 1 to 8 digit ID  number.   The
  default is the last four digits of the Radio serial number.   Digits 0 to
  9, *, and # may be used. Any unused digits may be filled in with a '-'
  character.
.P
SINGLETONE :
  This is the frequency of the tone that is sent.  The default is 104.9 Hz,
  with available tones ranging from 304.0 to 2470.0 Hz. Don't be alarmed if
  the  program "rounds" the frequency up or down by a few  Hertz.  Remember
  that  the  tones will tend to have a higher distortion as  the  frequency
  drops; we suggest tones above 1 kHz when installing new systems.
.P
GROUP ID                                                               4704

  The MDC-1200 id is a three hex digit number common to a group  of  Radios
and ranges from 000 to EEE.

  The DTMF id is a 1 to 8 digit id.   The digits 0 to 9,  *,  and # may  be
used.   It is IMPORTANT that the number of group digits does not exceed the
number of id digits because the Radio will never decode the group ID.
.P
CALL FORMAT                                                            4705

  There are 8 different choices for this field.  The choice determines  the
sequence  in which this Radio needs to see the QCII tones for an individual
or group call. The Up/Down arrow keys will scroll through the choices.  The
following is a list of those choices:

                  A-B  Tone A followed by Tone B.
              A-B/A-C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone A followed by Tone
                       C
              A-B/C-B  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone C followed by Tone
                       B
           A-B/Long B  Tone A followed by Tone B or Long Tone B
           A-B/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Long Tone C
.P

       A-B/A-C/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone A followed by Tone
                       C or Long Tone C
    A-B/Long B/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Long Tone B  or  Long
                       Tone C
A-B/A-C/Long B/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone A followed by Tone
                       C or Long Tone B or Long Tone C

In  this table the first sequence is considered an "individual call"  while
the other sequences would be considered "group calls."  For example:

     For  choice   A-B/A-C/LONG C,  an A-B sequence would be an "individual
call" while an A-C or LONG C would be a "group call". Group calls normally
cannot be acknowledged.
.P
CALL TYPE                                                              4706

  There are three different choices for this field.  The Up/Down arrow keys
will scroll through the following choices :  Call Alert,  Call Alert/Voice,
and  Voice  Selcall.   Call Alert leaves call indication at  the  receiving
Radio.    Call  Alert/Voice  leaves  a  call  indication  and  unmutes  the
loudspeaker  of the receiving Radio.   Voice Selcall unmutes loudspeaker on
receiving Radio but does not leave any call indication.  MDC-1200 does  not
allow Voice Selcall call type since Voice Selcall is an inherent feature of
all MDC-1200 signalling systems.
.P
PL/DPL REQUIRED                                                        4707

  The Up/Down arrow keys will allow the choices of either "Y" or "N".   "Y"
implies the correct PL/DPL is required to recieve data.  "N" implies PL/DPL
is  not  required  to receive data.  In most systems you  may  choose  "N",
however,  when  you  share  a channel with other users who  have  the  same
signalling type then you should choose "Y". Choosing "Y" on shared channels
will ensure that you don't accidentally receive a call which is directed to
another user.

ACKNOWLEDGE                                                            4708

  The Up/Down arrow keys will allow the choices of either "Y" or "N".   "Y"
implies an acknowledge transpond tone will be sent after a valid call.  "N"
implies no acknowledge will be sent after a valid call.  The Radio normally
will not acknowledge "group calls".

ACKNOWLEDGE TYPE                                                       4709

  The acknowledge type can be one of the four following choices :

  1.  DIGIT - One DTMF digit will be transmitted after a valid call.  Digit
              is entered on the Acknowledge Digit data field.
  2.  ID - The ID of the Radio will be transmitted after a valid call.
  3.  TONE - A predetermined tone will be transmitted after a valid call.
  4.  NO - No acknowledge will be sent after a valid call.

The Up/Down arrow keys will scroll through the allowable choices.

NOTE : QCII only has choices 3 and 4.

ACKNOWLEDGE DIGIT                                                      4710

  This  field  is is used in conjunction with the Acknowledge  type  field.
This is the digit that is transmitted after a valid call if the acknowledge
type is "DIGIT".  Digits 0 to 9, *, and # may be used to create a ONE digit
acknowledge digit.

ACK PRETIME                                                            4711

  Systems   that  use Call Alert require that the Radio  acknowledge  (ACK)
that the  Call Alert has been received.  ACK Pretime is the delay from when
the  Radio  receives  a  Call Alert to when it starts  the  ACK   sequence.
The default ACK pretime is 0.5 seconds.  If a different pretime is required
for your  system move the cursor to the ACK Pretime data field and   change
the time  using  the up and down arrow keys.  The range can be from 0.2  to
2.0 seconds in 0.1 second steps.

HORN/LIGHTS                                                            4712

  When a Call Alert is received,  an external output may be activated  that
can  be  used to control a vehicle's horn or lights.   Horn/Lights  may  be
selectable,  permanent,  or  not available.   If horn/lights are selectable
then  they may be defeated by the front panel Select button.   If they  are
permanent,  they cannot be defeated without an external switch in the relay
cable.  If they are not available, then they can never be activated.

HORN/LIGHTS DELAY                                                      4713

  When   External   Alarm  or Horn/Lights is activated by   the   operator,
Call   Alerts   will   activate  the  external  alarm  for  six    seconds.
Horn/Lights Delay will delay the activation of the external alarm to allow
the operator time,  if  he is in the vehicle, to respond to the Call  Alert
before   the  external alarm is activated.   If the operator  does  respond
during  the  delay time  the  external alarm will not  be  activated.   The
default  time  is  10.0 seconds.    If  a different Delay Time is  required
move  the   cursor   to  the Horn/Lights  Delay data field  and  enter  the
desired  delay.   Use the up  and down arrow keys to select a delay  of  0,
5.0, 10.0 or 15.0 seconds.

SIGNALLING SQUELCH                                                     4714

  This  feature can either be enabled "Y" or disabled "N" using the Up/Down
arrow  keys.   If this feature is enable "Y",  then the front panel monitor
button  can  be used to put the Radio into  signalling  squelch.   If  this
feature  is  disabled "N",  then signalling squelch is not  activated.  The
default is "N".

  Signalling  Squelch is similar to Private Line.  When enabled,  the Radio
will  only unmute for Call Alerts and Voice Selcalls.  Like  Private  Line,
Signalling  Squelch  can  be  disabled by pressing the  monitor  button  or
removing  the  microphone  from  the hang  up  clip.  You  will  find  that
Signalling Squelch is automatically disabled when channel scan is on.

DOS HOLDOFF                                                            4715
  Data   Operated   Squelch  (DOS)  is  used with  data signalling  systems
(such  as  MDC-1200)   to    mute    the  data  transmissions   to   reduce
operator  annoyance.   DOS  attempts  to  mute  the  speaker  when data  is
present  on  the channel.    DOS Holdoff keeps  the speaker muted   for   a
preset period  of time from when carrier is  detected   by    the   squelch
circuit.    This  allows the DOS time to detect any data  activity, further
reducing the annoyance of data being heard from the speaker.

  The  default  holdoff  is 0.5 seconds.    If a different holdoff time  is
required  for   your system  move the cursor to the DOS Holdoff data  field
and  change the   time using the Up/Down arrow keys.  The range can be from
0.0   to  4.3  seconds  in  0.1 second  steps.   The  Radio   automatically
defeats  DOS Holdoff while channel scan is turned on.

  If you want your unit id to be sent on each Push-to-talk (PTT),  then set
this field to "PRE", "POST", or "BOTH".  "PRE" sends the id at the press of
PTT. "POST" sends the id upon release of PTT. "BOTH" sends the id twice per
transmission,  once  at  the press and once at the release of PTT.  If  you
choose "NONE", then the id will not be sent during PTT.
.P
PTT SIDETONE                                                           4717

  PTT   sidetones   are  used when PTT ID is  activated.    Sidetones   are
heard  through the speaker when the operator first presses the  PTT.   They
are  used  to  tell  the  operator   that he cannot  speak  until  the   ID
has   been transmitted.  There are two sidetones available in the Radio.
The  PTT  ID Sidetone  is a continuous tone heard from PTT until the ID has
been  sent.  The second tone, PTT Short Sidetone, is a short beep after the
ID  has   been sent.    Both  tell  the operator when he is  permitted   to
speak  into  the microphone.   One,  both  or no Sidetones maybe activated.
They   can  be activated  by moving the cursor to the desired sidetone  and
using the Up/Down arrow keys to choose either "Y" or "N" to either activate
or deactivate the sidetones.
.P
  The Sidetone choice is also used when sending a call from the Call  List.
It is suggested that if this signalling system is to be used by a Call List
entry that the Sidetone(s) be enabled.

PTT SHORT SIDETONE                                                     4718

  PTT   sidetones   are  used when PTT ID is  activated.    Sidetones   are
heard  through the speaker when the operator first presses the  PTT.   They
are  used to  tell  the  operator  that he cannot yet speak until  the   ID
has   been transmitted.  There are two sidetones available in the Radio.
The PTT  ID Sidetone  is a continuous tone heard from PTT until the ID  has
been  sent.  The second tone, PTT Short Sidetone, is a short beep after the
ID  has   been sent.    Both  tell  the operator when he is  permitted   to
speak  into  the microphone.   One,  both  or no Sidetones maybe activated.
They   can  be activated  by moving the cursor to the desired sidetone  and
using  the  Up/Down arrow keys to choose either "Y" or "N" to  activate  or
deactivate the sidetones.

  The  Sidetone choice is also used when sending a call from the Call  List
and whenever a sequence is generated by pressing the 'Select' button.
It is suggested that if this signalling system is to be used by a Call List
entry that the Sidetone(s) be enabled.

PRETIME                                                                4719
  The    pretime    is  the  delay from the start  of  transmit  (when  the
operator pushes PTT) to when  the data signalling begins.    This delay  is
required   in  order  to  allow   the  Radio    to   completely   open  the
communications  path  through   repeaters  or  other   system   components.
The  default   pretime   is 0.5 seconds.    If  a  different   pretime   is
required  for your  system move the cursor  to  the Pretime data field  and
change the  time using the Up/Down arrow keys.   The
range can be from 0.1 to 4.3 seconds in 0.1 second steps.

FIXED RETRY WAIT                                                       4720

  When  emergency  is  activated  by  the  operator  the  Radio  expects an
acknowledge from the base station.  If no acknowledge is received then  the
Radio   will repeat the emergency sequence after a delay.  The Radio always
waits a random time greater than twice the Pretime.  The additional time is
the  Fixed Retry Wait time.  Fixed Retry Wait is the time the  Radio  waits
between emergency tries.  The default  is 0.0  seconds (STAR default is 8.1
seconds).   If  a  different Wait Time is required move the cursor to   the
Fixed  Retry  Wait data field and change the time using the  Up/Down  arrow
keys.   The  range  can be from 0.0 seconds to 16.9 seconds in  0.4  second
steps.

  When a PTT ID transmission is received by the Radio it contains the ID of
the  transmitting  Radio.   The name of the call entry associated with  the
transmitting Radio ID will be displayed on the screen.  If no call entry is
associated with the transmitting Radio ID, then "00" (not for DTMF) will be
displayed  on  the Radio.   Use the Up/Down arrow keys to choose either  to
have the transmitting Radio "name" displayed on the front  panel,  "Y",  or
not  to  have the transmitting Radio "name" displayed on the  front  panel,
"N".  Since  2  channel Radios do not have a display,  choosing "Y" is  not
recommended.

  One  Radio  in  the  system should be designated  as  the  Console  Radio
(Control Unit).   The purpose of this Radio is to acknowledge the receiving
Emergency Alert.   If this field is enabled "Y",  the Radio will respond to
an Emergency with an acknowledge transmission.   Use the Up/Down arrow keys
to  choose either "Y" or "N".  Since 2 channel Radios do not have a display
to show the unit ID of the transmitting Radio,  they are not recommended as
Console Radios.

  After   the  DTMF  decoder  has  received  a  valid  digit  it  waits   a
predetermined  time for the next expected tone before resetting.  Resetting
causes the decoder to look for the first digit of the ID. Reset Duration is
the time period that the decoder waits before resetting.  This duration may
be  set  from 0.2 to 33.0 seconds.  The default is  2.5  seconds.  Use  the
Up/Down arrow keys to change the default value if necessary.

This screen allows you to configure a call list so that you may selectively
call  other Radios.  Once this call list is complete,  you may use  the
'Select'  button  on  the front of your Radio to select the  individual  or
group that you wish to call.

The  list  is built one entry at a time.  The sequence of  the  entries  is
exactly  the same as the order you would select them from the front of  the
Radio. The entry sequence may be important for your customer, so it is best
to check with him/her first.

You  may mix different signalling formats in any order in the list.  Up  to
99  different  entries are allowed.  To create the first entry in  a  blank

This field determines on which channel the call will be sent. If you always
want  the call to go out on whatever channel your customer is on, then  you
want 'NONE'; do this by using the UP/DOWN keys or typing '00'.

If you always want the call to be sent on a specific channel,  then use the
UP/DOWN keys until this channel is displayed.  Remember, however, that when
the  call is complete the Radio will remain on the sending channel.

ACKNOWLEDGE EXPECTED                                                   4904
This  determines  whether or not the Radio will expect an acknowledge  from
unit(s) being called.  If an acknowledge is expected,  the Radio will:   a)
send the call up to 5 times  b) display an 'A' if the call is  acknowledged
or a '-A' if not acknowledged.

If  an acknowledge is not expected,  the Radio will only send the call  one
time and will not show any type of acknowledge display.

In general,  you would like to answer 'YES'. Group calls, however, normally
should  be  'NO'.   No acknowledge is expected for DTMF or Quik Call (their
acknowledge is heard only by the user and is not decoded).

Answering  'NO' to MDC-1200 individual entries is acceptable for call alert
and voice selcall, however, to send a Radio check you MUST answer 'YES'.
