MAIN MENU (cont)

Function Key Descriptions:

F1 - Additional  information  is available for every menu via the  F1  HELP 
     key.    Specific  help is also available for each field  on  all  data 
     entry  screens.  Generic help is available within any HELP screen  via 
     the MORE HELP function.

F2 - SERVICE  is a multi-level menu that permits access to radio  ALIGNMENT 
     and   BOARD  REPLACEMENT   screens.   Radius   contains  no   internal 
     alignment  or tuning adjustments; all alignment is performed  via  the 
     SERVICE screens.   

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

     A radio must be connected to your computer via the RIB before you will 
     be  permitted  to  access the SERVICE screens.   All  SERVICE  screens 
     access  the codeplug directly; therefore, you do NOT have to read  the 
     codeplug  data (via the GET/SAVE functions) before using  the  SERVICE 
     screens.  
 
F3 - GET/SAVE is used to read codeplug data from a radio and/or retrieve an 
     archived  codeplug from a diskette or hard disk for  editing  purposes 
     (via  the  CHANGE/VIEW function).  GET/SAVE is also  used  to  program 
     edited codeplug data back into the radio or to create an archive  file 
     on a diskette (or hard disk).  

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F4 - CHANGE/VIEW  is  a multi-level menu that is used to change,  view,  or 
     modify  codeplug  features and option  configurations.     All  Radius  
     codeplug  parameters  are classified as either RADIO-WIDE  or  CHANNEL 
     related.  CHANGE/VIEW permits access to each of these categories.

     Unlike  the  SERVICE  function, a codeplug must be  loaded  into  your 
     computer's  memory (via the GET/SAVE functions) before you can  access 
     the CHANGE/VIEW screens.  You may CHANGE/VIEW an archive file  without 
     a radio connected.  


.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F5 - A PRINT utility is available to produce permanent records of   codeplug 
     configurations  and/or RF alignment settings.  A printer  is   required 
     and should be connected to your computer per your instruction manual.

F6 - A FILE MAINTENANCE utility is available to create sub-directory  paths, 
     delete old archive files, restore archive files, and create new back-up 
     files.

F7 - Not Used.

F8 - Not Used.

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F9 - SETUP  is  used to configure your  Radius  Radio Service  Software  to 
     your  particular  application.   Default  disk  drives,  communication 
     ports,  and  even  screen colors may be customized  to  your  specific 
     needs.

F10 - Select  EXIT  to quit the program and return to  DOS.   Be  sure  all 
      desired codeplug changes have been programmed back to the radio,  and 
      that  an archive copy has been made.   Otherwise all changes will  be 
      lost  since  returning  to DOS erases this data from  the  computer's 
      memory.

Internal  accessories are accessories that are physically placed inside the 
radio and do not actually use the connector.  Connections are made internal 
to  the radio but still use the pin functions.  At this time there is  only 
one Internal Accessory.  This is the DTMF decoder board. The decoder should 
be installed in the radio BEFORE programming. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to 
either enable or disable the DTMF decoder board. Trunked radios do not have 
any internal accessory.

Only  certain models of the  Radius radio are capable of  scanning  receive 
mode  frequencies.  Scanning radios have two priority frequencies that  are 
scanned  periodically  whether or not there is channel activity.   In  Mode 
Slaved  Scan the first priority is the current Mode displayed when Scan  is 
activated.   The  second  priority is radio wide and  can  be  selected  or 
disabled on this screen.

You  may enter the Mode Number for the desired second priority or  you  may 
enter 'OFF' which will remove the second priority.  You may also use the up 
and  down arrow keys to select the desired Mode.  If the Mode  is  invalid, 
you will be prompted for a new value.

UP/DOWN arrows to select this value.  Enable the feature by selecting Y.

.P
PRIORITY SAMPLING METHOD                                               4243

Priority Sampling Method determines the way in which the priority channel(s)
is checked for activity during a "lookback" from an active priority-2 or
non-priority channel.  There are two methods, CONTINUOUS and 1-SHOT PL.  Use
the UP/DOWN arrows to change this value.

CONTINUOUS always performs a complete check of the channel.  If no carrier
is present, then the sampling ends.  If a carrier is present, a full PL
check is made on each sample.

For 1-SHOT PL, once a carrier is seen, a full PL sample is only done once
until a sample is seen with no carrier present (i.e. carrier "break").

.P
SCAN SPEED                                                             4244

Scan Speed determines how long each channel is checked for carrier and PL.
There are three rates available: SLOW, NORMAL and FAST.

SLOW is the most reliable and does not affect sensitivity.  NORMAL is the 
default and probably the most commonly used scan speed.  FAST risks a loss
of carrier detect, degrading the range.  FAST is most applicable when Rx
frequencies are less than 5 MHz.  FAST should only be used where strong 
signal conditions exist.

Use the UP/DOWN arrows to change this value.
.P
PRIORITY SAMPLING RATE                                                 4245

Priority Sampling Rate determines how often the priority channel is sampled
for activity when listening to priority-2 or non-priority channels.  This
sampling process is known as "lookback" and causes holes in the received
audio.  The time chosen determines the length of time between samples.  The
value can range from 0.5 to 4.2 seconds, with the default being 0.9 seconds.
Use the UP/DOWN arrows to change this value.

The best choice is always a compromise between probability of missed
syllables on the priority channel and intelligibility of the lower priority
channel.  For critical use (public safety, etc.), we suggest using the 
fastest time.
.P
PRIORITY CHANNEL TONE                                                  4246

Priority Channel Tone is a feature that alerts the user that the radio's
scan has stopped on a priority channel.  This tone is a high-pitched short
tone.  It can be enabled by using the UP/DOWN arrows to select Y.

                            !!! WARNING !!!

Enabling the priority channel tone can cause a loss of 100 ms of the
priority channel audio.
.P
SCAN HANG TIME                                                         4247

The Scan Hang Time determines how long the radio will remain on the channel
after receiving the end of a transmission.  During this time, the radio
will still perform priority samples as required.  The scan hang time should
be as short as necessary to maintain message continuity.  The default value

SCAN TALK BACK                                                        4248

The conventional channel scan has the capability to revert to the home mode 
(home  revert) or stay on the busy channel (talk back) when the  microphone 
is removed from the hang-up clip.  These capabilities are now  programmable 
from  Radio  Service  Software.  The default is  home  revert.   To  change 
capabilities  use the up and down arrow keys to select "N" for home  revert 
scan and "Y" for talk back scan.

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION                                                   4291    
                             !! WARNING !!
  
Mismatching  the Data Direction with the accessory may result in damage  to 
the  radio  or accessory or both.  Therefore,  use caution  when  selecting 
functions for non standard accessories.  The direction is determined by the 
selected function and is not programmable.  ALWAYS program the radio BEFORE 
connecting  a new option.  Also verify that the new option does not  exceed 
the limits of the radio's drive circuitry. In general, the limits look like 
this:                                                 
                    outputs:  open collector, 200 mA amximum drive           
                              with a saturation voltage of 0.3 V max.       
                    inputs:   0 to 16 Volts, signals below 1.0 V logic low, 
                              signals above 3.0 V are logic high.     
.P
Each  programmable  pin  has a limited number of functions  that  can  be 
assigned  to  it.  Some  internal and  external  accessories  need  certain 
functions  in  order  to  operate  properly.  These  functions  are  called 
'dependent'  functions.  Dependent functions will NOT changed and will  get 
skipped.  Remaining functions are 'independent' of specific accessories and 
are  called  'independent'  functions.   "General  I/O"  with  no  internal 
accessory allows the most programmable 'independent' functions.

WARNING:  Do not use the SAME 'independent' function more than once on this 
          screen.  The radio will not respond as expected to two or more of 
          the same 'independent' functions. 
.P
The following is a list of the available independent functions:

function: Null            
  pin(s): 4,6,8,9,12,14                                
 purpose:  The  correct  definition  for any pin which is not  being  used. 

function: External Alarm
  pin(s): 4
 purpose:  An  output  which can drive a normally  open  relay.  The  relay 
           connects to the vehicle horn/lights. Driven by an open collector 
           transistor which saturates to A+,  with the capability to source 
           200 mA. 
.P
function: Tx PL Inhibit
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose:  An input which can inhibit the generation of PL while the  radio 
           is  transmitting.  A typical application would be 'stripping PL' 
           when sending a page from an attached paging  terminal.  Normally 
           this  line should be toggled prior to asserting PTT,  since  the 
           radio  will need to dekey and rekey if the line is toggled while 
           transmitting. 

function: TOC Disable
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the radio will disable the generation of PL reverse 
          burst and DPL turn off code when a transmission ends. This can be 
          useful  for some base station and phone patch  setups. 
.P
function: Tx Audio Mute
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose:  This  input to the radio mutes the MIC AUDIO input,  allowing an 
           external  option to drive the FLAT TX AUDIO INPUT.  This is  for 
           connections to paging encoders,  data terminals,  etc. To ensure 
           that the transmit deviation never exceeds the legal limits,  the 
           device  connected should not gate audio to FLAT TX  AUDIO  INPUT 
           unless  Tx  Audio  Mute is asserted FIRST. 

function: PL/DPL & CSQ Detect
  pin(s): 4,8,12,14
 purpose:  This output from the radio indicates that a carrier with correct 
           PL is present. 
.P
function: CSQ Detect
  pin(s): 4,8,12,14
 purpose:  This  output from the radio indicates that there is a carrier on 
           the channel. 

function: Emergency Switch
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the radio is used in conjunction with signalling to 
          send  and receive emergency alarms.  It defaults to  the  correct 
          active level for a normally closed switch connected to ground. It 
          is  recommended that this function be removed when the  Emergency 
          Alarm  field on the RADIO WIDE screen is set to 'NONE'.  
.P
The following is a list of independent functions that are ONLY available on
radios with V21.00 or later software:

function: Rx Audo Mute 
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the radio mutes receive audio for data applications.

function: Special Off Hook
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the radio readies the audio amplifier to accept
          externally generated sidetones.

function: Channel Steer 1-3
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the radio works as a BCD channel selector input.
.P
DEBOUNCE                                                               4292

Debounce determines whether the radio waits a short period of time before 
acting.  This  is  done to make sure that any mechanical switch  bounce  is 
accounted for.  It is only active on INPUTS. Debouncing is usually required 
for  pins that are driven by relays or other mechanical devices.  Functions 
that  have Debounce as "NO" should not use relays or mechanical devices  to 
drive them. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to enable "Yes" or disable "No".
.P

ACTIVE LEVEL                                                           4293

Active  Level determines whether the pins will become active on either  a 
high voltage or a low voltage.  Some non standard accessories may not  have 
the  same active level as the default active level.  Use the Up/Down  arrow 
keys to enable "High" or disable "Low".
.P

POWER UP DELAY                                                         4294

The radio ignores the active levels on the programmable pins during power 
up.  This  is done to give the accessory device time to initialize  itself. 
The time that the radio delays is the Power Up Delay.  The default time for 
this  delay  is 0.2 seconds.  If this delay needs to be  changed,  use  the 
Up/Down arrow keys. This value can range from 0.0 seconds to 4.3 seconds.
.P

CHANGE/VIEW MODE CONFIGURATION                                         4500

MODE Configuration is used to CHANGE/VIEW channel specific information such 
as frequencies, squelch type, squelch codes, and scan lists.

Warning:  CHANGE/VIEW does NOT actually modify the radio codeplug data, but 
          instead  it  modifies  a  copy of the  data  retrieved  from  the 
          codeplug (or archive file) via the GET/SAVE functions.

          After  all  CHANGE/VIEW modifications  are  completed,  you  MUST 
          return to the GET/SAVE menu and PROGRAM the changes back into the 
          radio  or  SAVE  them  to a  new  archive  file.   Otherwise  the 
          modifications will be lost when you turn off your computer.

NAME                                                                   4501

NAME  is the number displayed on the two digit seven segment display.   The 
NAME  data field allows the number displayed to be different than the  mode 
number.  This,  for  example,  allows  the channels to be displayed  in  an 
unusual  order such as 1,2,4,5.  Any sequence desired can be chosen.  A few
words of caution should be given:
    
     a.   Earlier radio software versions do NOT support this feature! 
     b.   The name will have no effect on 2 channel radios.

.P

     c.   Choose names  which  are not easily  confused  with  the  numbers 
          displayed by the call list entries.
     d.   On  low  band radios there may be difficulties viewing the  noise 
          blanker status.
     e.   When programming a user scan list,  channel names greater than 19 
          tend to be hard to recognize.   

Valid numbers are between 01 and 99.

BUSY CHANNEL LOCKOUT                                                   4512

Busy  Channel Lockout may be enabled by choosing "Y".  When enabled,  the 
radio will be 'polite' to other users on the channel.  In other words,  the 
radio will not let you hear conversations of other users and will not allow 
you  to transmit on top of another user.  The only calls you will hear  are 
those  with  your PL code,  even if you are off hook or press  the  monitor 
button.  If  you  press PTT on the radio while there is a  carrier  on  the 
channel, the radio follows this protocol:

.P

          a. If the carrier has your PL, then you are allowed to transmit
             just like normal.
          b. If the carrier has no PL or the wrong PL, then you will hear
             a  busy  tone while you hold PTT.  Release PTT and  try  again 
             later.

If you choose "N", then the radio will transmit and receive like a normal 
two-way radio.

Enter  here  the number of the DTMF/PHONE signalling system  that  has  the 
access and deaccess code you want to use on this channel. The access  (ANI) 
sequence  is  sent  when the 'select' button is pressed. If  phone  is  not 
desired, do NOT assign a system here.

TIME-OUT-TIMER (TOT)                                                   4514

If Enabled, the TOT will limit the maximum time allowed for any  continuous 
transmission  from  1  to 255 seconds on all  transmit  channels.   Receive 
operation is not affected by the TOT.

Use  the UP/DOWN arrow keys to select the desired time.  You will  see  the

Tx Inhibit on Busy, if enabled, will disable transmit while carrier is 
present on a channel (channel is busy).  A busy tone will be heard when the
PTT is pressed.  Use the UP/DOWN arrows to change this value.  Choosing Y
will enable this feature.
.P
LOCAL/DISTANCE                                                         4516

Local/Distance is a feature that affects radio sensitivity and interference
rejection.  Use the UP/DOWN arrows to select a value for this feature.

Use LOCAL in areas of dense radio usage (suburbs and major cities).  LOCAL
improves IM performance dramatically, but loses some sensitivity.

Use DX (distance) when in an area where radio is decoding weak signals 
(rural area).

DIAL SIGNALLING SYSTEM                                                 4602

This is the signalling system that will be used to dial phone numbers. We 
made this separate from the access signalling system so that you may 
customize  things  such as dialing speed. For example, some  phone  systems 
will allow faster dialing than the phone patch.

SYSTEM                                                                 4700

This  screen  allows  you to configure one or  more  signalling  systems.  
These  signalling systems will be used by the Call List and Mode screens to 
determine when and where decode or encode.
.P

TYPE                                                                   4702

When this screen is displayed the cursor is placed on the TYPE data  field.  
There  are  seven available system types.   They are None,  STAR,  MDC1200, 
QCII  (QUIK CALL), DTMF, Singletone and DTMF/PHONE. The  system  types  are 
selected  by using the Up/Down arrow keys.    None implies that all of  the 
signalling  systems in the radio are  deactivated.    When  STAR,  MDC1200, 
QCII,  Singletone, DTMF, or Singletone is activated  the associated
parameter data fields will be displayed.  
.P

ID                                                                     4703

MDC1200 :
  MDC1200 requires that each radio have a unique four digit ID number.  The 
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.  The range is 
  from  0001 to DEEE.   Four zeroes will show up as "NONE";  this is useful 
  when you desire the radio to "listen only". An example of a "listen only" 
  situation  might  be  a  volunteer fireman  monitoring  a  fire  dispatch 
  channel. 

DTMF :
  DTMF  requires each radio to have a unique 1 to 8 digit ID  number.   The 
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.   Digits 0 to 
  9, *, and # may be used. Any unused digits may be filled in with a '-'
  character.
.P

STAR :
  STAR  requires that each radio have a unique four digit ID  number.   The 
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.  The range is 
  from  0000 to 16383.  You may enter the ID in two ways.  The first way is 
  without the tag bits added to the ID.  In this case, you will type in the 
  ID that you want to have appear on the dispatcher's console  first.  Then 
  on the tag bit line you will set the proper combination for the customer. 
  If  the channel is only being used by one customer,  then chances are the 
  tags will be 0 0. The third line shows you what the ID would look like in 
  a  system  which  uses  the tag bits as  an  extension  of  the  ID.  For 
  reference, the first tag bit adds 8192 to the ID and the second adds 4096 
  to the ID.   
.P

QCII :
  QCII ID corresponds to tones A, B, and C. It requires at least two unique
  tones.  The default is 358.6 Hz (tone A), 903.s Hz (tone B), and  0.0  Hz
  (tone C). The range is from 304.0 to 2470.0 Hz. Don't be alarmed if the
  frequency that you type in changes by a few Hertz. This change can occur
  because the program must calculate the nearest frequency that the radio
  can understand. You will find that the error will always be within the
  acceptable industry bandwidth.

SINGLETONE :
  This is the frequency of the tone that is sent. The default is 1049.7 Hz, 
  with available tones ranging from 304.0 to 2470.0 Hz. Don't be alarmed if 
  the  program "rounds" the frequency up or down by a few  Hertz.  Remember 
  that  the  tones will tend to have a higher distortion as  the  frequency 
  drops; we suggest tones above 1 kHz when installing new systems.    
.P

GROUP ID                                                               4704

The  MDC1200 id is a three hex digit number common to a group  of  radios 
and ranges from 000 to EEE.

The DTMF id is a 1 to 8 digit id.   The digits 0 to 9,  *,  and # may  be 
used.   It is IMPORTANT that the number of group digits does not exceed the 
number of id digits because the radio will never decode the group ID.
.P

CALL FORMAT                                                            4705

There are 8 different choices for this field.  The choice determines  the 
sequence  in which this radio needs to see the QCII tones for an individual 
or group call. The Up/Down arrow keys will scroll through the choices.  The 
following is a list of those choices:  

                  A-B  Tone A followed by Tone B.
              A-B/A-C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone A followed by Tone 
                       C 
              A-B/C-B  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone C followed by Tone 
                       B
           A-B/Long B  Tone A followed by Tone B or Long Tone B
           A-B/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Long Tone C
.P

       A-B/A-C/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone A followed by Tone 
                       C or Long Tone C
    A-B/Long B/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Long Tone B  or  Long 
                       Tone C
A-B/A-C/Long B/Long C  Tone A followed by Tone B or Tone A followed by Tone 
                       C or Long Tone B or Long Tone C   

In  this table the first sequence is considered an "individual call"  while 
the other sequences would be considered "group calls."  For example:
 
For  choice   A-B/A-C/LONG C,  an A-B sequence would be an "individual 
call" while an A-C or LONG C would be a "group call". Group calls normally  
cannot be acknowledged.      
.P

CALL TYPE                                                              4706

There are three different choices for this field.  The Up/Down arrow keys 
will scroll through the following choices :  Call Alert,  Call Alert/Voice, 
and  Voice  Selcall.   Call Alert leaves call indication at  the  receiving 
radio.    Call  Alert/Voice  leaves  a  call  indication  and  unmutes  the 
loudspeaker  of the receiving radio.   Voice Selcall unmutes loudspeaker on 
receiving radio but does not leave any call indication.   MDC1200 does  not 
allow Voice Selcall call type since Voice Selcall is an inherent feature of 
all MDC1200 signalling systems.
.P

PL/DPL REQUIRED                                                        4707

The Up/Down arrow keys will allow the choices of either "Y" or "N".   "Y" 
implies the correct PL/DPL is required to recieve data.  "N" implies PL/DPL 
is  not  required  to receive data.  In most systems you  may  choose  "N", 
however,  when  you  share  a channel with other users who  have  the  same 
signalling type then you should choose "Y". Choosing "Y" on shared channels 
will ensure that you don't accidentally receive a call which is directed to 
another user. 

Note :  Some existing DTMF and Quik Call systems require PL stripping, and 
therefore it is recommended that an "N" be chosen in these cases. 
.P

ACKNOWLEDGE                                                            4708

The Up/Down arrow keys will allow the choices of either "Y" or "N".   "Y" 
implies an acknowledge transpond tone will be sent after a valid call.  "N" 
implies no acknowledge will be sent after a valid call.  The radio normally 
will not acknowledge "group calls".
.P

ACKNOWLEDGE TYPE                                                       4709

The acknowledge type can be one of the four following choices :

  1.  DIGIT - One DTMF digit will be transmitted after a valid call.  Digit 
              is entered on the Acknowledge Digit data field.
  2.  ID - The ID of the radio will be transmitted after a valid call.
  3.  TONE - A predetermined tone will be transmitted after a valid call.
  4.  NO - No acknowledge will be sent after a valid call.

The Up/Down arrow keys will scroll through the allowable choices.

NOTE : QCII only has choices 3 and 4.
.P

ACKNOWLEDGE DIGIT                                                      4710

This  field  is is used in conjunction with the Acknowledge  type  field.  
This is the digit that is transmitted after a valid call if the acknowledge 
type is "DIGIT".  Digits 0 to 9, *, and # may be used to create a ONE digit  
acknowledge digit.
.P

ACK PRETIME                                                            4711

Systems   that  use Call Alert require that the radio  acknowledge  (ACK)  
that the  Call Alert has been received.  ACK Pretime is the delay from when  
the  radio  receives  a  Call Alert to when it starts  the  ACK   sequence.   
The default ACK pretime is 0.5 seconds.  If a different pretime is required 
for your  system move the cursor to the ACK Pretime data field and   change  
the time  using  the up and down arrow keys.  The range can be from 0.2  to  
2.0 seconds in 0.1 second steps.
.P

HORN/LIGHTS                                                            4712         

When a Call Alert is received,  an external output may be activated  that 
can  be  used to control a vehicle's horn or lights.   Horn/Lights  may  be 
selectable,  permanent,  or  not available.   If horn/lights are selectable 
then  they may be defeated by the front panel Select button.   If they  are 
permanent,  they cannot be defeated without an external switch in the relay 
cable.  If they are not available, then they can never be activated.
.P

HORN/LIGHTS DELAY                                                      4713

When   External   Alarm  or Horn/Lights is activated by   the   operator,   
Call   Alerts   will   activate  the  external  alarm  for  six    seconds.  
Horn/Lights Delay will delay the activation of the external alarm to allow 
the operator time,  if  he is in the vehicle, to respond to the Call  Alert  
before   the  external alarm is activated.   If the operator  does  respond 
during  the  delay time  the  external alarm will not  be  activated.   The 
default  time  is  10.0 seconds.    If  a different Delay Time is  required 
move  the   cursor   to  the Horn/Lights  Delay data field  and  enter  the 
desired  delay.   Use the up  and down arrow keys to select a delay  of  0, 
5.0, 10.0 or 15.0 seconds.

SIGNALLING SQUELCH                                                     4714

This  feature can either be enabled "Y" or disabled "N" using the Up/Down 
arrow  keys.   If this feature is enable "Y",  then the front panel monitor 
button  can  be used to put the radio into  signalling  squelch.   If  this 
feature  is  disabled "N",  then signalling squelch is not  activated.  The 
default is "N".

Signalling  Squelch is similar to Private Line.  When enabled,  the radio 
will  only unmute for Call Alerts and Voice Selcalls.  Like  Private  Line, 
Signalling  Squelch  can  be  disabled by pressing the  monitor  button  or 
removing  the  microphone  from  the hang  up  clip.  You  will  find  that 
Signalling Squelch is automatically disabled when channel scan is on.

DOS HOLDOFF                                                            4715

Data   Operated   Squelch  (DOS)  is  used with  data signalling  systems 
(such  as  MDC-1200)   to    mute    the  data  transmissions   to   reduce  
operator  annoyance.   DOS  attempts  to  mute  the  speaker  when data  is 
present  on  the channel.    DOS Holdoff keeps  the speaker muted   for   a  
preset period  of time from when carrier is  detected   by    the   squelch 
circuit.    This  allows the DOS time to detect any data  activity, further  
reducing the annoyance of data being heard from the speaker. 

The  default  holdoff  is 0.5 seconds.    If a different holdoff time  is 
required  for   your system  move the cursor to the DOS Holdoff data  field 
and  change the   time using the Up/Down arrow keys.  The range can be from 
0.0   to  4.3  seconds  in  0.1 second  steps.   The  radio   automatically  
defeats  DOS Holdoff while channel scan is turned on.

PTT ID                                                                 4716

If you want your unit id to be sent on each Push-to-talk (PTT),  then set 
this field to "PRE", "POST", or "BOTH".  "PRE" sends the id at the press of 
PTT. "POST" sends the id upon release of PTT. "BOTH" sends the id twice per 
transmission,  once  at  the press and once at the release of PTT.  If  you 
choose "NONE", then the id will not be sent during PTT.     
.P

PTT SIDETONE                                                           4717

PTT   sidetones   are  used when PTT ID is  activated.    Sidetones   are  
heard  through the speaker when the operator first presses the  PTT.   They 
are  used  to  tell  the  operator   that he cannot  speak  until  the   ID  
has   been transmitted.  There are two sidetones available in the  Radius.  
The  PTT  ID Sidetone  is a continuous tone heard from PTT until the ID has  
been  sent.  The second tone, PTT Short Sidetone, is a short beep after the 
ID  has   been sent.    Both  tell  the operator when he is  permitted   to  
speak  into  the microphone.   One,  both  or no Sidetones maybe activated. 
They   can  be activated  by moving the cursor to the desired sidetone  and 
using the Up/Down arrow keys to choose either "Y" or "N" to either activate 
or deactivate the sidetones. 
.P

  The Sidetone choice is also used when sending a call from the Call  List. 
It is suggested that if this signalling system is to be used by a Call List 
entry that the Sidetone(s) be enabled.

PTT SHORT SIDETONE                                                     4718

PTT   sidetones   are  used when PTT ID is  activated.    Sidetones   are  
heard  through the speaker when the operator first presses the  PTT.   They 
are  used to  tell  the  operator  that he cannot yet speak until  the   ID  
has   been transmitted.  There are two sidetones available in the  Radius.  
The PTT  ID Sidetone  is a continuous tone heard from PTT until the ID  has  
been  sent.  The second tone, PTT Short Sidetone, is a short beep after the 
ID  has   been sent.    Both  tell  the operator when he is  permitted   to  
speak  into  the microphone.   One,  both  or no Sidetones maybe activated. 
They   can  be activated  by moving the cursor to the desired sidetone  and 
using  the  Up/Down arrow keys to choose either "Y" or "N" to  activate  or 
deactivate the sidetones. 
.P

The  Sidetone choice is also used when sending a call from the Call  List 
and whenever a sequence is generated by pressing the 'Select' button. 
It is suggested that if this signalling system is to be used by a Call List 
entry that the Sidetone(s) be enabled.

PRETIME                                                                4719

The    pretime    is  the  delay from the start  of  transmit  (when  the 
operator pushes PTT) to when  the data signalling begins.    This delay  is 
required   in  order  to  allow   the  radio    to   completely   open  the 
communications  path  through   repeaters  or  other   system   components.    
The  default   pretime   is 0.5 seconds.    If  a  different   pretime   is  
required  for your  system move the cursor  to  the Pretime data field  and 
change the  time using the Up/Down arrow keys.   The 
range can be from 0.1 to 4.3 seconds in 0.1 second steps.

FIXED RETRY WAIT                                                       4720

When  emergency  is  activated  by  the  operator  the  radio  expects an 
acknowledge from the base station.  If no acknowledge is received then  the 
radio   will repeat the emergency sequence after a delay.  The radio always 
waits a random time greater than twice the Pretime.  The additional time is 
the  Fixed Retry Wait time.  Fixed Retry Wait is the time the  radio  waits 
between emergency tries.  The default  is 0.0  seconds (STAR default is 8.1 
seconds).   If  a  different Wait Time is required move the cursor to   the 
Fixed  Retry  Wait data field and change the time using the  Up/Down  arrow 
keys.   The  range  can be from 0.0 seconds to 16.9 seconds in  0.4  second 
steps.

When a PTT ID transmission is received by the radio it contains the ID of 
the  transmitting  radio.   The name of the call entry associated with  the 
transmitting radio ID will be displayed on the screen.  If no call entry is 
associated with the transmitting radio ID, then "00" (not for DTMF) will be 
displayed  on  the radio.   Use the Up/Down arrow keys to choose either  to 
have the transmitting radio "name" displayed on the front  panel,  "Y",  or 
not  to  have the transmitting radio "name" displayed on the  front  panel, 
"N".  Since  2  channel radios do not have a display,  choosing "Y" is  not 
recommended.

One  radio  in  the  system should be designated  as  the  Console  Radio 
(Control Unit).   The purpose of this radio is to acknowledge the receiving 
Emergency Alert.   If this field is enabled "Y",  the radio will respond to 
an Emergency with an acknowledge transmission.   Use the Up/Down arrow keys 
to  choose either "Y" or "N".  Since 2 channel radios do not have a display 
to show the unit ID of the transmitting radio,  they are not recommended as 
Console radios.

After   the  DTMF  decoder  has  received  a  valid  digit  it  waits   a 
predetermined  time for the next expected tone before resetting.  Resetting 
causes the decoder to look for the first digit of the ID. Reset Duration is 
the time period that the decoder waits before resetting.  This duration may 
be  set  from 0.2 to 33.0 seconds.  The default is  2.5  seconds.  Use  the

call  other radios.  Once this call list is complete,  you may use  the 
'Select'  button  on  the front of your radio to select the  individual  or 
group that you wish to call.

The  list  is built one entry at a time.  The sequence of  the  entries  is 
exactly  the same as the order you would select them from the front of  the 
radio. The entry sequence may be important for your customer, so it is best 
to check with him/her first.
                                          
You  may mix different signalling formats in any order in the list.  Up  to 
99  different  entries are allowed.  To create the first entry in  a  blank 
list, you will have to use the F8 key.

The  name/number that will show on the radio display whenever this entry is 
being selected. This will can be any number from 1 to 126.  We suggest that 
the number be large so that your customer can easily distinguish that  this 
is not a channel number.

This field determines on which channel the call will be sent. If you always 
want  the call to go out on whatever channel your customer is on, then  you 
want 'NONE'; do this by using the UP/DOWN keys or typing '00'.

If you always want the call to be sent on a specific channel,  then use the 
UP/DOWN keys until this channel is displayed.  Remember, however, that when 
the  call is complete the radio will remain on the sending channel.
.P

ACKNOWLEDGE EXPECTED                                                   4904

This  determines  whether or not the radio will expect an acknowledge  from 
unit(s) being called.  If an acknowledge is expected,  the radio will:   a) 
send the call up to 5 times  b) display an 'A' if the call is  acknowledged 
or a '-A' if not acknowledged.

If  an acknowledge is not expected,  the radio will only send the call  one 
time and will not show any type of acknowledge display. 

.P

In general,  you would like to answer 'YES'. Group calls, however, normally 
should  be  'NO'.   No acknowledge is expected for DTMF or Quik Call (their 
acknowledge is heard only by the user and is not decoded). 

Answering  'NO' to MDC1200 individual entries is acceptable for call  alert 
and voice selcall, however, to send a radio check you MUST answer 'YES'.
.P

Answering  'YES'  to this question will cause the radio to  send  the  call 
without  PL  or  DPL.  This can be useful if you want to selectively call a  
group  or  unit  without disturbing everyone else  on  the  channel   (this 
normally CANNOT be done on a community repeater!)

INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, or FLEET call.

Individual  Id - It is four digits long.   The numbers 0-9 and letters  A-F   
                 can  be  used.  'F'  acts as a wildcard  and  'E'  is  not 
                 available for the first digit.

Group Id - Three selectable digits,  0-F.  The first digit is automatically 
           inserted by the program.

        Default:  N

Radio  Check Encoding is a Call List feature.  If you wish to use ANY  call 
list  position to send Radio Checks,  then choose 'Y'.  If you choose  'N', 
then  the user will not be able to select Radio Check (usually displayed as 
'RC')  using the Select button on the front of the radio.  Not all  formats 
allow the user to send Radio Checks;  currently only MDC-1200 does.  If you 
answer  'Y',  the  user  will only see 'CH' on the display  for  Call  List 
entries that are MDC-1200.
.P

LOW BATTERY

        Choices:  Y, N
        Default:  N

This  feature is normally only for mobiles used in repeater situations,  or 
for battery powered,  unattended sites. Whe the battery voltage drops below 
a threshold (approximately 10 volts DC),  then the low battery alert can be 
triggered.  The  alert will automatically send the Call List sequence  from 
Call  List entry 1.  This can be any signalling format that the  Call  List 
allows. The low battery alert will be repeated once every 15 minutes. Since 
the  format is chosen by the Call List,  the alert could simply be a  tone, 
could autodial a phone patch, or page another radio.

AUTO RESET TIMER                                                       4745 

        Choices:  Off to 60 seconds, 1 second increments
        Default:  7 seconds

This  timer has many functions.  One of it's primary purposes is to control 
the receiver unmuting characteristics.  For example,  the timer can be used 
as  a Conversation Reset after a Call Alert has been  decoded.  This  timer  
should  be set long enough to allow the user to have a decent conversation, 
but  not  so  long as to subject the user to a significant  amount  of  co-

PTT REPEAT TIMER                                                       4746

        Choices:  Off to 60 seconds, 1 second increments
        Default:  007 seconds 

This timer determines how often during a transmission that the PTT ID  will 
be  inserted.  The PTT ID timer comes into play when the signalling  system 
being  used  has one of the '..  REPEAT' choices selected for PTT  ID.  The 
timer  starts to count down when PTT is first pressed.  When the  time  has 
expired,  the  microphone audio is muted and the PTT ID is sent.  The timer 
will then reset itself and start counting down again. 

The timer also comes into play if the PTT ID choice is '..  ONCE'.  In this 
case the PTT ID is only sent once,  in one transmission,  during the PTT ID 
Timer period. 

If the PTT ID choice is 'N',  'PRE', 'POST', or 'BOTH', then this timer has 
no effect.

TX HOLD TIME                                                           4747

        Choices:  Off to 1.1 seconds, approximately 0.01 second increments
        Default:  Off   

This is the period of time,  after completion of an encode  sequence,  that 
the  transmitter  remains  keyed  (without PL if the  transmission  was  PL  
stripped.)  For concantenated sequences,  this time is only applied to  the 
final  sequence in the series.  The inter-sequence delay would be equal  to 
the pretime of the following sequence.
.P

CALL LIST TIME OUT                                                     4748

        Choices:  Off to 255 seconds, 1 second increments
        Default:  Off

This  determines how long a user can 'camp' in the Call List.  If the  user 
remains in the Call List,  without sending a call, for the time out period, 
then the radio will automatically return to the normal 'dispatch mode.'  If 
this  timer is turned 'Off',  then the user can remain in the Call List for 
an infinite period of time.
.P

SELECT V SIDETONES

        Choices:  Enabled or Disabled
        Default:  Enabled  

On  Select V signalling systems,  the user can have a choice of the  normal 
RapidCall sidetones or true Select V tones from the radio speaker as encode 
sequences are transmitted.  Many users are accustomed to the Select V tones 
and may prefer them, however, RapidCall tones may be preferable when mixing 
several signalling formats in the same radio.

        Choices:  0 to 1.050 seconds, approximately 13 ms increments
        Default:  0 seconds

This  is the length of time that the transmitter will be active,  with  the 
microphone muted,  prior to the start of a Select V encode sequence. If the 
encode sequence is being sent PL stripped, then the pretime will also be PL 
stripped.  Pretime  allows  the transmitter to reach full power before  the 
start of the sequence and allows the receiver to lock and stabilize.

        Choices:  0 to 12.75 seconds, 50 ms increments
        Default:  0 seconds

In  some  cases,  the  first  tone of an encode sequence  may  need  to  be

        Choices:  one to seven digits, 0 thru 9 or -
        Default:  01234--

This  is  where  the Select V digit strings are  defined.  Each  string  is 
independent of length and format.  For example, you can define one sequence 
to be three digits long,  and another to be 5 digits long. If you need more 
than  seven  digits,  some features such as the external call button  allow 
several  sequences  to be concantenated (strung together.) All  you  define 
here  is  the  digit string itself;  the tone frequencies  and  timing  are 
defined by the signalling system(s) that you assign the sequence to.  A '-' 
means 'blank'.

        Choices:  0 thru 9, G, R, B, C, D, F    
        Default:  -

This  is the digit that is assigned for the Group type.  This digit is used 
for either standard or expanded group call decoding.  This digit should  be 
assigned  a  'G'  for standard group call decoding.  This digit  should  be 
assigned anything other than a 'G' for expanded group call decoding.  A '-' 
means 'blank'. 

It is important to remember that the group call decoding depends upon   the 
Group Type  and  the  Group Positions.

        Choices:  S, E, -
        Default:  - 

This allows a number of mobiles or portables to be simultaneously called as 
a group,  in addition to the individual call function.  A '-' means 'blank' 
and disables the Group Call. Entering an 'E' will enable the Expanded Group 
Call.  Entering  an 'S' will enable the Standard Group Call.  Group Type is 
dependent upon Group Digit and Group Positions. 

It  is  important  that you do not enter a digit that is also used  in  the 
Decode Sequence.

        Choices: 'X' or -
        Default: -------

Defines  the  digit positions in the decode sequence at  which  Group  Call  
tones  will be accepted.  A '-' means 'blank' or no Group Call tone will be 
accepted at this position. An 'X' means a Group Call tone will be accepted 
at  this position.  Do not assign an 'X' in a position which has  not  been 
defined  in the Decode Sequence.  Group Positions is dependent  upon  Group 
Digit and Group Type.

This unit can be programmed over-the-air using a mobile or a portable radio 
with  a DTMF keypad. Over-the-air programming is useful for  minor  changes 
after  the system has been initially set up and installed. The access  code 
is used to enter the program mode. Once you have entered the program  mode, 
you may modify any of the system configuration features or the user config
uration   features. To enter the program mode, enter the access  code  fol
lowed  by a "#" key. Listen for chirps, which indicate proper  access.  The 
default access code is 12310. The range is 00000 - 12310.
.p

In order to exit the program mode, you must enter a "99" followed by a  "#" 
key. Listen for a ringing prompt tone, which confirms that you have  exited 
program mode.


               !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WARNING  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MORSE ID INTERVAL                                                     4254

The  Morse  Code  station identification can be  programmed  in  frequency, 
interval,  and  speed. Each user has its own independent station  ID  timer 
that  is accurate to one second per interval. When the station ID is  sent, 
the  timer is reset. The call is transmitted on the first dispatch  message  
after the timer has expired. The default interval is 15 minutes. The  range 
is 1 - 99 minutes.

The  Morse  Code  station identification can be  programmed  in  frequency, 
interval,  and speed. During normal dispatch, the minimum  character  speed 
will  be  15 wpm. This allows the "List" functions (using Morse code  as  a 
format)  to  be  sent at a very slow speed, while  maximizing  airtime  use 
during  normal dispatch. The default speed is 22 wpm. The range is 4  -  25 
wpm.

COURTESY TONE FREQUENCY                                               4257

The  courtesy  tone is used for courtesy tone and  prompt  beeps.  Courtesy 
tones  and prompt beeps are usually sent when the user unkeys. They are  an 
indication to the other users that it is okay to key up. Without the  cour
tesy  tone and prompt beeps, the user generally will wait for the  repeater 
to  drop before keying up. The default frequency is 1000 Hz. The  range  is 
400 - 2500 Hz.  

A possible reason to change the frequency would be to differentiate between 
co-channel repeaters to know which repeater site is active.

You must enable the COURTESY TONE itself on a user by user basis.
.P

SYSTEM ID/CARRIER REPEAT ID                                           4258

A  user number may be assigned as the system id so that the  repeater  will 
identify every MORSE ID INTERVAL. Before sending the System ID, the follow
ing conditions must be met:

      a. The MORSE ID INTERVAL timer must expire.
      b. The ZR310 must be inactive (TPL/DPL Decode LED off).
      c. The System ID must have a user number programmed.

The  System ID user will be referenced for TPL/DPL encode and MORSE  ID  to 
send.  An enabled or disabled user number can be used. The default  is  00. 
The range is 00 - 70.

The MORSE code station ID is sent after a 0.75 second keyup delay.

ACC/TX SQUELCH CODE                                                   4259

An accessory device such as a tone remote or local microphone may need  the 
ZR310  to encode a particular TPL tone or DPL code in order to  communicate 
with  a specific user group. This value indicates the TPL tone or  the  DPL  
code that the accessory device needs the ZR310 to encode. When an accessory 
keys the transmit radio, the ZR310 will disable the repeater transmit  hold 
time until 30 seconds of no accessory transmit has expired. The default  is 
00. The range is 00 (CSQ) - any supported TPL tone or DPL code.

ANTI-KERCHUNKER TIMER                                                 4260

This  feature  is intended to help discourage users from  keying  and  then 
quickly dekeying the repeater ("kerchunking"). Users will often do this  to 
determine  whether or not they are within range of the repeater. The  first 
transmission  from  a user must be longer than the value of this  timer  in 
order for the programmed transmit hold time not  to be used. The default is 
0.0 seconds. The range is from 0.0 - 5.0 seconds in 0.1 second increments.

TIMEOUT TIMER                                                         4261

This  is a "stuck mic" timeout feature. Its setting determines  the  maxium 
amount of time a mobile may transmit on the channel. Each time the  TPL/DPL 
decode stops, the timer is reset. During a timeout condition, you will hear 
an  alert  tone before the transmit radio unkeys. The default  value  is  3 
minutes. The range is from 1 - 9 minutes in 1 minute increments.
.P

STATUS                                                                4262

This  indicates the status of the current user. A user has three  types  of 
status; disabled, enabled, or reserved. A nonactive user would be disabled. 
An active user would be enabled. A user MUST BE ENABLED BEFORE the user can 
be reserved. A reserved user is an active user who is  temporarily  inacti
vated  for seasonal user or a possible "no-pay" condition. A reserved  user 
may  also  be a reserved TPL tone or DPL code that is reserved  for  future 
use.  A reserved user will keep the tone active in the repeater, preventing 
other co-channel repeater operators from seeing the tone as "availabe".  If 
a user keys up on a reserved user number, the transmitter will be keyed but 
it  does not repeater any audio. It sends a beep tone for the  duration  of 
the transmission. 
.P

RX SQUELCH CODE                                                       4263

The ZR310 can decode all 50 TPL tones and up to 20 DPL codes. The TPL  user 
numbers are 1 - 50 and they have fixed frequencies. The DPL user numbes are 
51  - 70 and they can be assigned any valid DPL code. When you set the  DPL 
decode  number,  the DPL encode will automatically be set the same  as  the 
decode. Refer to the table below for users and their assigned codes.

The  MORSE  ID is a station ID call sign that is assigned to  a  particular 
user. The first time the user unkeys, the ZR310 sends the MORSE ID. If  the 
user keys up again, voice communictions may occur during the ID. The ID  is 
sent at 30% deviation and a selectable speed from 4 to 25 words per  minute 
(wpm). With system programming, the MORSE ID Interval, MORSE ID Speed,  and 
MORSE  ID Frequency can be assigned. The default is a blank or no MORSE  ID 
(incidated  by  spaces). The range is any combination of digits 0  -9,  and 
letters  A-Z and can be up to 8 characters long.

TX HANG TIME                                                          4265

This  is the amount of time the repeater transmitter remains keyed  on  the 
channel  after  mobile activity is no longer detected. The default  is  0.2 
seconds. It ranges from 0.0 seconds to 25.0 seconds.
.P

PL/DPL DURING HANG                                                    4266

Normally the repeater encode signal follows the mobile encode. However, you 
can  leave  a  TPL or DPL encode on during the transmitter  hang  time.  By 
leaving  the encode on, you can eliminate the decode time between  tranmis
sions,  thus not losing any audio. The default is N. Choose Y to leave  the 
encode on during transmit hold time, or N to turn it off.

PRIVACY MODE                                                          4267

The  privacy  mode prevents new TPL tones or DPL codes from  being  decoded 
during the transmit hold time. The default is N. Choose Y to enable privacy 
mode, or N to disable it.
.P

COURTESY TONE                                                         4268

The  courtesy  tone  is a beep that sounds whenever a user  unkeys.  It  is 
helpful  when  a group of mobiles with strong (full quieting)  signals  are 
close  to the repeater, because it is often difficult to determine  when  a 
mobile  unkeys. You can set the tone frequency with the System  Programming 
(Courtesy  Tone Freq). The courtesy beep will assist in conserving  airtime 
so that each mobile doesn't wait for the repeater to drop each time between 
transmissions.  The  system operator can use this feature on  a  "per  user 
basis" to gain additional revenue from users desiring the beep, or to indi 
cate  certain  groups of users. The default is N. Choose Y  to  enable  the 
courtesy tone, or N to disable it.

This allows you to go directly to a specific user without having to use the 
F4/F3 keys to scroll through the list. 

This also allows you to directly enable a user.

PL USER GOTO/ADD USER                                                 4271

This  will  allow you to directly goto a specific user by typing  in  their 
user number. You may only goto enabled users.

This will also allow you to enable a user. This makes it a little easier to 
add a user because you will be able to add a user as you are looking at the 
whole picture instead of having to go back to the previous screen and  then 
add a user. Once you get done adding a user, you can return to the previous 
screen and you will already be at the newly enabled users information.  You 
can now edit the users information.

When multiple ZR320s are used with a ZR330, or multiple ZR330s, the Unit ID 
is  used to distinguish between different ZR320s in the system.  A  typical 
application  would be a single ZR330 with foreign exchange (FX)  lines  for 
calling into more than one dialing area. The default is 0. The range is 0 - 
9.

MORSE ID                                                              4273

If  set, the ZR320 transmits the call sign of the repeater station  at  the 
end of each phone call. The station ID option sets the station's Morse Code 
ID.  The ID is sent at the end of each call at 30% deviation and  25  words 
per  minute (wpm). The ID tone frequency is 1 kHz. The default is  a  blank 
field. The maximum length is 8 characters.

AUTOCALL USER                                                        4274

The autocall user number serves two purposes:
   a. Designates a default user, who is called if a caller does not specify 
      a user number within five seconds after making a connection to the
      ZR320. This works in conjunction with the single-user/multi-user 
      mode.
 
   b. Determines what action to take when the phone rings, and the ZR320 is
      operating in single-user mode.

The default is 00. The range is 00 - 99.

The access code must be entered before calling the user number and   steer
ing  digit to sign-on the ZR320. The default is '*'. The range is digits  0 
-9 and '*'. The code can be up to eight digits long.
.P

DEACCESS CODE                                                         4276

The deaccess code must be entered before calling the user number to discon
nect  a call in progress. The default is '#'. The range is 0 - 9  and  '#'. 
The code can be up to eight digits long.
.P

TOLL BYPASS CODE                                                      4277
The   toll bypass code is a code that can be entered from a radio prior  to 
entering  the Access Code to  bypass the  toll restrict digits 1 and 2.  It 
eliminates any dialing  restrictions. This feature works in conjuction with 
the toll restrict 1 and toll restrict 2 information. The default is "99".
.P

PROGRAM CODE                                                          4278

The program code is used to gain access to the ZR320's program mode from  a 
DTMF  equipped radio, portable, or DTMF telephone. It is not  required  for 
RSS  programming. The default is 12320. It may be any digit 0 - 9. It  must 
be exactly five digits in length.  

              !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    WARNING   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do  NOT make the program code a subset of the access code. If you  do,  the 
ZR320 will not be programmable over the air.

RINGS TO ANSWER                                                       4279

The rings to answer feature determines when the ZR320 begins ringing on the 
channel (single-user) or when it answers the phone (multi-user).

In  single-user  mode,  the  ZR320 doesn't need an  overdial  digit  so  it 
proceeds with the call when the number of rings from the PSTN has  exceeded 
the number set. 

In  multi-user mode, the ZR320 answers the phone after the number of  rings 
from the PSTN has exceeded the count as set above. 

The rings to answer can be set to :
  a. 1 ring before answering (default)
  b. 3 rings before answering
  c. 5 rings before answering

DISCONNECT ON BUSY                                                    4280

The  ZR320  can  use the VOX circuit for detecting a busy  signal  on   the 
telephone  line.  AFter 10 cycles of busy tone are detected,  the  call  is 
terminated.

The Detect Busy can be set for:
  a. NO CHECKING for busy signal 
  b. CHECK for busy signal during first 20 seconds of call (default)
  c. CHECK for busy signal continuously throughout the call
.P

RADIO TIMEOUT                                                         4281

Because  the  radio  party must be in control of the  interconnect  at  all 
times,  some  means of automatically terminating a call  is  required.  The 
Inactivity  Timer is the amount of time that the ZR320 allows the  call  to 
continue without the presence of carrier. The Inactivity Timer is a  safety 
net for times when a radio gets out of range and cannot terminate the call.

The Radio Timeout can be set to:
   a. 30 seconds (default)
   b. 45 seconds
   c. 60 seconds
.P

CALL LIMIT                                                            4282

The  ZR320  has a call limit timer that is used to restrict the  length  of 
calls.  Double warning beeps are sent every 3 seconds starting  15  seconds 
before the call is to be terminated.

The call limit timer can be set to:
   a. Off 
   b. 3 minutes (default)
   c. 5 minutes
   d. 10 minutes

QCII TONE GROUPS                                                      4283

QCII  Tone Groups 1 and 2 are used for selecting tones for signalling  pag
ers.  The user number is used to select the tones. Each digit in  the  user 
number can be set to correspond with a frequency in one of six tone groups. 
The  first digit of the user number (in the 10's place) corresponds to  the 
first  tone from the QCII and the second digit of the user number (in   the 
1's  place) corresponds to the second tone from the QCII. If the first  and 
second  digits generate the same frequency, a group call  (an  eight-second 
tone of the same frequency) will be issued.

The  defaults  are tone group 1 for QCII Tone 1 and tone group 2  for  QCII 
Tone Group 2. The QCII Group 1 and Group 2 digits can be set to  correspond 
to frequencies in tone groups 1-6.
.P

RING ON CHANNEL                                                       4284

The  ring on channel determines how the ZR320 will ring on the air  when  a 
user is called over the radio channel. For the ZR330 user, this option  has 
no effect; the ZR320 rings until the ZR330 answers. 

The Rings to Connect can be set to:
   a. Once and wait - The ZR320 sends a single ring over the channel and
                      waits for the radio to answer within the mobile 
                      answer time.
   b. Until answer  - The ZR320 rings on the air until the radio answers,
                      for up to the mobile answer time (default).
.P

SINGLE-USER/MULTI-USER                                                4285

The ZR320 can operate in Single-User or Multi-User mode.

In the Single-User mode, the call is directed to the autocall user  immedi
ately.

In the Multi-User mode, a caller to the ZR320 must enter a user number.  If 
the  user number is not entered within five seconds of making  the  connec
tion,  the call will be put through to the autocall user.

The default is N or Single-User mode. The choices are Y or Multi-User  mode 
and N or Single-User mode.

DUPLEX/SIMPLEX MODES                                                  4286

Interconnect modes for a duplex repeater:
  * Half Duplex - This mode provides normal conversation for the caller.
                  The radio user may only listen for speaker. Allows the
                  radio user to interrupt the caller but the caller can
                  not interrupt the radio user.

  * Full Duplex - This is normal "telephone" operation. The caller and  
                  the radio user can talk and listen at the same time.
                  Either may interrupt the other at any time. This is 
                  the mode of operation for the ZR320/ZR330 combination.
                  A full duplex radio is required for this mode.

.P
Interconnect modes for a simplex radio:
  * Simplex VOX - The radio user to phone connection uses the COR indi-
                  cation of the simplex radio. The phone to radio user
                  connection uses the voice detection circuits (VOX) of
                  the ZR320. Both paths are talk or listen but not at 
                  the same time. The phone to radio user path or the radio
                  user to phone path is determined on a "first-come-first-
                  served" basis.
  * Simplex Prekey - Same basic operation as Simplex VOX except loss of 
                     COR from the simplex radio will key the transmitter
                     of the simplex radio in anticipation of the phone
                     caller speaking.

STOP SCAN TONE                                                       4287

You  can specify a TPL tone or DPL code as the stop scan tone. This  option 
is  sytem  wide, so each time a QCII page is transmitted, the  set  TPL/DPL 
will  accompany  it.  When scanning with QCII as the squelch  system  on  a 
GP300/GM300, the radio will detect the subaudible TPL/DPL, and will  remain 
on   the   channel   as  long as the tone  is  transmitted.   Without   the  
TPL/DPL  decode,  the  radio will remain on the QCII channel  during   scan  
whenever  there is activity on the channel. Programming a TPL or  DPL  stop 
scan  tone, however,  speeds  up the scanning process, because, as soon  as  
the  paging message begins,  the  subaudible frequency is no  longer  sent, 
and the  radio  will continue scanning other channels. The default is  Off. 
The choices are  Off, any TPL frequency, and DPL code (023-754).
.P

COURTESY TONE                                                         4288

When  using  TPL with rverse-burst or DPL in a quiet  area,  sometimes  the 
telephone party is unable to tell when the radio user has stopped  talking. 
The  courtesy or "roger" tone (1 kHz) indicates to the telephone user  when 
it  is  time to speak. It is always disabled on radio to radio  calls.  The 
default is N. Choose "Y" to enable the tone or "N" to disable the tone.
.P

PRIVACY MODE                                                          4289

Privacy  mode  is an option for blocking out one side of  the  conversation 
when  the repeater is operating in half-duplex mode. When privacy  mode  is 
on,  a  high-pitched tone is sent in place of the receive  audio  from  the 
radio,  thus discouraging casual eavesdropping by scanner  listeners,  etc. 
The  default  is "N". Choose "Y" to enable the tone or "N" to  disable  the 
tone.
.P

CARRIER REPEAT                                                        4300

The  carrier repeat option is to enable the repeater function.  If  TPL/DPL 
has  been programmed on the receive radio, only received signals  with  the 
correct  TPL  or  DPL are repeated. The default is "Off".  Choose  "On"  to 
enable the repeater or "N" to disable the repeater.

ANSWER TIME                                                           4301

The  answer  time is the amount of time allowed for a radio to  answer  the 
call before the call is forwarded to the call forward user, if such a  user 
has been programmed. A call can be forwarded twice before it is terminated.

An  example  of multiple call forwarding would be a user who is  called  at 
home on a ZR330. If the user does not answer, the call is forwarded to  his 
radio. If the radio does not answer, the call gets forwarded to his  pager, 
where the caller's number is recorded. In this way, very complicated commu
nication schemes can be supported. 

The default is 30 seconds. The range is 10 - 60 seconds.
.P

DIALING MODE                                                          4302

The  ZR320  dials into the Public Switched Telephone Network  (PSTN).  When 
used  with the ZR330, the pulse setting instructs the ZR320 to  pulse  dial 
all  DTMF  digits. The DTMF setting instructs the ZR320 to  pass  the  DTMF 
commands from the radio or ZR330 directly to the telephone. 

The Dialing Mode can be set to:
  a. Pulse - using 40/60 make-break ratio rotary pulses at 10 pps (pulses
             per second)
  b. DTMF  - using nonregenerated DTMF digits  (default)

TOLL RESTRICT                                                         4303

Use   the  toll restrict feature for a repeater on an internal  phone   ex
change.  Its function is to limit telephone calls from mobile radio  users. 
The  values  entered for  toll  restrict 1 designate certain digits  to  be  
"prohibited"   as   the  first digit in the telephone  number.  The  values 
entered for toll restrict 2 designate certain digits to be "prohibited"  as 
the second digit in a  telephone  number. If a radio user dials any of  the 
toll  restrict 1 digits  as the first digit or any of the toll  restrict  2 
digits for the second  digit, the call will be terminated. 

The default setting is a blank field (no restrictions). Up to four separate 
values can be set for the toll restrict digits; each in the range of 0 - 9.

PAGER TALK TIME                                                       4304

When  calling  a tone + voice pager, the hang time determines  the  maximum 
amount  of time that the caller's voice may be transmitted on the  channel. 
If  the  pager  hang time is set to 10, the call  is  terminated  after  10 
seconds.  Also, as soon as there is a loss of carrier from a mobile,  or  a 
gap of 2 seconds is dtected in the caller's voice (using the VOX  circuit), 
the call is terminated. 

The default is 10 seconds. The range is 1 - 30 seconds.

TX HANG TIME                                                          4305

The  transmitter, or repeater,  hang  time is the amount of time after loss   
of   the  received signal  carrier before the transmitter is  actually  un
keyed. This keeps  the transmitter  from  being  keyed/unkeyed continuously 
between  gaps  in  the conversation.  The default is 3 seconds. The choices 
are Off, 1  second,  3 seconds, or 5 seconds.

VOX HANG TIME                                                         4306

When the ZR320 is operating in the simplex VOX or simplex VOX with pre-key, 
the  VOX hang time keeps the transmitter keyed during small gaps or  pauses 
in  the telephone party's speech. The default is 1.0 second.  The   choices 
are 0.5 second, 0.8 second, 1.0 second, 1.3 second, and 1.5 second.

COR HANG TIME                                                         4307

During simplex operation, the COR hang timer is used to desensitize the COR 
input  for  times  when the mobile is fading or  picketfencing.  The  ZR320 
remains  in the mobile to telephone mode for a programmable period of  time 
after  carrier is dropped. The default is 0.0 second. The choices are   0.0 
second, 0.1 second, 0.3 second, or 0.5 second.

CALL FORWARD USER                                                     4310

The  call forward user contains the user number of the user to whom a  call 
is  forwarded if the active user does not answer. Because calls  to  pagers 
are  not expected to be answered, call forwarding is not used on tone  only 
or  tone  & voice pagers. Remember that a user number cannot be  used  more 
than  once  on the same system. Therefore, it is not possible to  have  one 
radio  user  that  decodes TPL tone 67.0 Hz and  another  radio  user  that 
decodes  DPL  025 on the same system since user slot 01 would  have  to  be 
programmed as both TPL radio and DPL radio. Multiple users (00 and 51 - 99) 
can be set for an equipment type of carrier squelch.
