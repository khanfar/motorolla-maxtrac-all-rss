MAIN MENU (cont)

Function Key Descriptions:

F1 - Additional  information  is available for every menu via the  F1  HELP
     key.    Specific  help is also available for each field  on  all  data
     entry  screens.  Generic help is available within any HELP screen  via
     the MORE HELP function.

F2 - SERVICE  is a multi-level menu that permits access to radio  ALIGNMENT
     and   BOARD  REPLACEMENT   screens.  MaxTrac   contains  no   internal
     alignment  or tuning adjustments; all alignment is performed  via  the
     SERVICE screens.

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

     A radio must be connected to your computer via the RIB before you will
     be  permitted  to  access the SERVICE screens.   All  SERVICE  screens
     access  the codeplug directly; therefore, you do NOT have to read  the
     codeplug  data (via the GET/SAVE functions) before using  the  SERVICE
     screens.

F3 - GET/SAVE is used to read codeplug data from a radio and/or retrieve an
     archived  codeplug from a diskette or hard disk for  editing  purposes
     (via  the  CHANGE/VIEW function).  GET/SAVE is also  used  to  program
     edited codeplug data back into the radio or to create an archive  file
     on a diskette (or hard disk).

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F4 - CHANGE/VIEW  is  a multi-level menu that is used to change,  view,  or
     modify  codeplug  features and option  configurations.     All MaxTrac
     codeplug  parameters  are classified as either RADIO-WIDE  or  CHANNEL
     related.  CHANGE/VIEW permits access to each of these categories.

     Unlike  the  SERVICE  function, a codeplug must be  loaded  into  your
     computer's  memory (via the GET/SAVE functions) before you can  access
     the CHANGE/VIEW screens.  You may CHANGE/VIEW an archive file  without
     a radio connected.

F5 - A PRINT utility is available to produce permanent records of   codeplug
     configurations  and/or RF alignment settings.  A printer  is   required
     and should be connected to your computer per your instruction manual.

F6 - A FILE MAINTENANCE utility is available to create sub-directory  paths,
     delete old archive files, restore archive files, and create new back-up
     files.

F7 - Not Used.

F8 - Not Used.

.P
MAIN MENU (cont)

F9 - SETUP  is  used to configure your MaxTrac  Radio Service  Software  to
     your  particular  application.   Default  disk  drives,  communication
     ports,  and  even  screen colors may be customized  to  your  specific
     needs.

F10 - Select  EXIT  to quit the program and return to  DOS.   Be  sure  all
      desired codeplug changes have been programmed back to the radio,  and
      that  an archive copy has been made.   Otherwise all changes will  be
      lost  since  returning  to DOS erases this data from  the  computer's
      memory.

     from the computer to the radio codeplug.

     A  radio and RIB must be properly connected to the computer and  power
     turned on before you attempt the PROGRAM function.

     The  time required to PROGRAM a codeplug will depend directly on  your
     computer  type and the size of the codeplug you are programming.   The
     status  of  the PROGRAM operation is displayed at the  bottom  of  the
     screen.

CHANGE/VIEW is a multi-level menu that is used to change,  view,  or modify
codeplug features and option configurations.    All codeplug parameters are
classified  as either RADIO-WIDE or CHANNEL related.   CHANGE/VIEW  permits
access to each of these categories.

Unlike the SERVICE function, a codeplug must be loaded into your computer's
memory  (via the GET/SAVE functions) before you can access the  CHANGE/VIEW
screens.  You may CHANGE/VIEW an archive file without a radio connected.

.P
Warning:  CHANGE/VIEW does NOT actually modify the radio codeplug data, but
          instead  it  modifies  a  copy of the  data  retrieved  from  the
          codeplug (or archive file) via the GET/SAVE functions.

          After  all  CHANGE/VIEW modifications  are  completed,  you  MUST
          return to the GET/SAVE menu and PROGRAM the changes back into the
          radio  or  SAVE  them  to a  new  archive  file.   Otherwise  the
          modifications will be lost when you turn off your computer.

Function Key Descriptions:

F2 - RADIO-WIDE  Configuration is used to CHANGE/VIEW radio parameters  and
     options that affect overall radio operation, i.e. those not related to
     a specific channel such as the time-out-timer.

.P
Function Key Descriptions:

F5 - MODE Configuration is used to CHANGE/VIEW channel specific information
     such as frequencies, squelch type, squelch codes and scan lists.

F7 - SIGNAL   SYSTEM  Configuration is  used  to  CHANGE/VIEW  Signalling
     System parameters and options such as ID's, Pretimes, and  Emergency
     operation.

F9 - CALL  LIST Configuration is used to CHANGE/VIEW Call List  parameters
     such as ID's, Acknowledge Expected, and Strip PL.

.P
CHANGE/VIEW RADIO-WIDE CONFIGURATION                                   4200

RADIO-WIDE  Configuration  is  used to  CHANGE/VIEW  radio  parameters  and
options that affect overall radio operation, i.e. those not just related to
a specific channel such as the time-out-timer.

Warning:  CHANGE/VIEW does NOT actually modify the radio codeplug data, but
          instead  it  modifies  a  copy of the  data  retrieved  from  the
          codeplug (or archive file) via the GET/SAVE functions.

          After  all  CHANGE/VIEW modifications  are  completed,  you  MUST
          return to the GET/SAVE menu and PROGRAM the changes back into the
          radio  or  SAVE  them  to a  new  archive  file.   Otherwise  the
          modifications will be lost when you turn off your computer.

TIME-OUT-TIMER (TOT)                                                   4203

If Enabled, the TOT will limit the maximum time allowed for any  continuous
transmission  from  1  to 255 seconds on all  transmit  channels.   Receive
operation is not affected by the TOT.

Use  the UP/DOWN arrow keys to select the desired time.  You will  see  the
display  change  in  one second increments.  The data  field  may  also  be
changed  by typing the desired time or "OFF" from the keyboard.  The  range
is from OFF to 255 seconds.

PRIORITY 2 SCAN MODE                                                   4204

Only  certain models of the MaxTrac radio are capable of  scanning  receive
mode  frequencies.  Scanning radios have two priority frequencies that  are
scanned  periodically  whether or not there is channel activity.   In  Mode
Slaved  Scan the first priority is the current Mode displayed when Scan  is
activated.   The  second  priority is radio wide and  can  be  selected  or
disabled on this screen.

You  may enter the Mode Number for the desired second priority or  you  may
enter 'OFF' which will remove the second priority.  You may also use the up
and  down arrow keys to select the desired Mode.  If the Mode  is  invalid,
you will be prompted for a new value.

OFF-HOOK PL/DPL                                                        4206

The capability of OFF-HOOK PL/DPL operation can be programmed as a
"RADIO WIDE" function using the RSS field programmer.  Going "offhook" with
the microphone on a channel receiving the wrong PL/DPL code will not
unsquelch the radio.  The monitor button functions as normal, unsquelching
the radio regardless of the current PL/DPL code.  To change capabilities
use the up and down arrow keys to select "N" to disable OFF-HOOK PL/DPL
operation and "Y" for OFF-HOOK PL/DPL operation.
.P
SERIAL NUMBER                                                          4215

The radio Serial Number, which is stored in the codeplug, can be viewed but
cannot be changed.

EMERGENCY ALARM                                                        4220

 *** NOTE ***
It is important to have an emergency switch connected to the radio when the
codeplug is changed.  If you do not, the radio will immediately go into the
Emergency sequence and turn on the transmitter.

Emergency  is a "Radio Wide" feature instead of a "Mode" feature  to  allow
Emergency  to  be available at all times even when the radio is on  a  non-
signalling  mode.  Use  the  Up/Down arrow keys to select a  "standard"  or
"silent" emergency or no,  "none",  emergency.  It is recommended that this
field  be  set  to "NONE" whenever there is NO  Emergency  Switch  function
enabled on the "Other Accessory" screen.
.P
Now   move  the cursor to the REVERT MODE data field and  enter  the   Mode
number  that  will be used to transmit the Emergency sequence on  with  the
Up/Down  arrow keys.  Now when emergency is activated by the operator   the
radio   will switch to the Revert Mode (Dedicated Emergency  Channel)   and
start  the  Emergency sequence.  If it is desired that  Emergency  sequence
transmit   on  the  current operator selected Mode then press  the  Up/Down
arrow key till "NONE" appears in the REVERT MODE data field.

Note  :  If  "NONE"  is  selected,  then EVERY  mode  MUST  be  capable  of
transmitting an emergency (Tx signalling system = MDC1200 or STAR).
.P
PRIORITY SAMPLING RATE                                                 4230

When the channel scan is stopped on a non-priority channel, it periodically
"looks back" at the priority channel for activity.  The rate at which  this
"look  back"  occurs  is  the priority sample  rate.  There are  two  rates
available,  slow  and fast.  Slow is 1.5 seconds between "look  backs"  and
Fast is 0.5 seconds between "look backs".  Slow is the default.  To  change
the sample rate use the up and down arrow keys to select the rate.

NOTE : Earlier radio software versions do NOT support this feature!
.P
HANDSET                                                                4231

The  radio needs to know when a handset is connected to the radio in  order
to  know when to mute the loudspeaker.  The loudspeaker is muted  when  the
handset  is removed from the hang-up cup.  To enable handset  muting,  move
the  cursor  to the Handset data field and use the up and  down  arrows  to
select "N" for no handset muting and "Y" for handset muting.

The conventional channel scan has the capability to revert to the home mode
(home  revert) or stay on the busy channel (talk back) when the  microphone
is removed from the hang-up clip.  These capabilities are now  programmable
from  Radio  Service  Software.  The default is  home  revert.   To  change
capabilities  use the up and down arrow keys to select "N" for home  revert
scan and "Y" for talk back scan.

NOTE : Earlier radio software versions do NOT support this feature!

ACC INTERNAL                                                           4233

Internal  accessories are accessories that are physically placed inside the
radio and do not actually use the connector.  Connections are made internal
to  the radio but still use the pin functions.

At this time, there is only one Internal Accessory, the DTMF decoder board.
The decoder should be installed in the radio BEFORE programming.

Use the Up/Down arrow keys to either enable/disable the DTMF decoder board.

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION                                                   4291
                             !! WARNING !!

Mismatching  the Data Direction with the accessory may result in damage  to
the  radio  or accessory or both.  Therefore,  use caution  when  selecting
functions for non standard accessories.  The direction is determined by the
selected function and is not programmable.  ALWAYS program the radio BEFORE
connecting  a new option.  Also verify that the new option does not  exceed
the limits of the radio's drive circuitry. In general, the limits look like
this:
                    outputs:  open collector, 200 mA maximum drive
                              with a saturation voltage of 0.3 V max.
                    inputs:   0 to 16 Volts, signals below 1.0 V logic low,
                              signals above 3.0 V are logic high.
.P
  Each  programmable  pin  has a limited number of functions  that  can  be
assigned  to  it.  Some  internal and  external  accessories  need  certain
functions  in  order  to  operate  properly.  These  functions  are  called
'dependent'  functions.  Dependent functions will NOT change  and will  get
skipped.  Remaining functions are 'independent' of specific accessories and
are  called  'independent'  functions.   "General  I/O"  with  no  internal
accessory allows the most programmable 'independent' functions.

WARNING:  Do not use the SAME 'independent' function more than once on this
          screen.  The radio will not respond as expected to two or more of
          the same 'independent' functions.
.P
The following is a list of the available independent functions:

function: Null
  pin(s): 4,6,8,9,12,14
 purpose:  The  correct  definition  for any pin which is not  being  used.
           Applies to all radios.

function: External Alarm
  pin(s): 4
 purpose:  An  output  which can drive a normally  open  relay.  The  relay
           connects to the vehicle horn/lights. Driven by an open collector
           transistor which saturates to A+,  with the capability to source
           200 mA. Applies to all radios.
.P
function: Tx PL Inhibit
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose:  An input which can inhibit the generation of PL while the  radio
           is  transmitting.  A typical application would be 'stripping PL'
           when sending a page from an attached paging  terminal.  Normally
           this  line should be toggled prior to asserting PTT,  since  the
           radio  will need to dekey and rekey if the line is toggled while
           transmitting. Does not apply to trunked radios.

function: TOC Disable
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the radio will disable the generation of PL reverse
          burst and DPL turn off code when a transmission ends. This can be
          useful  for some base station and phone patch  setups.  Does  not
          apply to trunked radios.
.P
function: Tx Audio Mute
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose:  This  input to the radio mutes the MIC AUDIO input,  allowing an
           external  option to drive the FLAT TX AUDIO INPUT.  This is  for
           connections to paging encoders,  data terminals,  etc. To ensure
           that the transmit deviation never exceeds the legal limits,  the
           device  connected should not gate audio to FLAT TX  AUDIO  INPUT
           unless  Tx  Audio  Mute is asserted FIRST.  Does  not  apply  to
           trunked radios.

function: PL/DPL & CSQ Detect
  pin(s): 4,8,12,14
 purpose:  This output from the radio indicates that a carrier with correct
           PL is present. Does not apply to trunked radios.
.P
function: CSQ Detect
  pin(s): 4,8,12,14
 purpose:  This  output from the radio indicates that there is a carrier on
           the channel. Does not apply to trunked radios.

function: Emergency Switch
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input to the radio is used in conjunction with signalling to
          send  and receive emergency alarms.  It defaults to  the  correct
          active level for a normally closed switch connected to ground. It
          is  recommended that this function be removed when the  Emergency
          Alarm  field on the RADIO WIDE screen is set to 'NONE'.  Does not
          apply to trunked radios.
.P
function: Rx Audio Mute
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
 purpose: This input is used to mute the received audio or to signal an AVL
          emergency condition.  Applies to all radios.

function: PA Switch
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
          This input is used to inhibit PTT  for  Public  Address. Does NOT
          apply to conventional radios.

function: I/O Mic Off Hook
  pin(s): 6,8,9,12,14
          This input is used to signal radio when a remote microphone is
          Off hook. Does not apply to conventional radios.
.P
DEBOUNCE                                                               4292

Debounce determines whether the radio waits a short period of time before
acting.  This  is  done to make sure that any mechanical switch  bounce  is
accounted for.  It is only active on INPUTS. Debouncing is usually required
for  pins that are driven by relays or other mechanical devices.  Functions
that  have Debounce as "NO" should not use relays or mechanical devices  to
drive them. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to enable "Yes" or disable "No".
.P
ACTIVE LEVEL                                                           4293

  Active  Level determines whether the pins will become active on either  a
high voltage or a low voltage.  Some non standard accessories may not  have
the  same active level as the default active level.  Use the Up/Down  arrow
keys to enable "High" or disable "Low".
.P
POWER UP DELAY                                                         4294

  The radio ignores the active levels on the programmable pins during power
up.  This  is done to give the accessory device time to initialize  itself.
The time that the radio delays is the Power Up Delay.  The default time for
this delay is 0.187 seconds.  If this delay needs to be  changed,  use  the
Up/Down arrow keys. This value can range from 0.0 seconds to 4.301 seconds.
.P
LOW POWER                                                              4323

Use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to Enable or Disable the LOW POWER feature
for this personality.

If LOW POWER is enabled,  then the radio will transmit at a reduced RF
power level on this personality.   This  feature  is  provided  to  reduce
adjacent channel interference.  The factory default for LOW POWER is 4
watts.

If LOW POWER is disabled, then the radio will transmit at full power on
this personality.
.P
CHANGE/VIEW MODE CONFIGURATION                                         4500

MODE Configuration is used to CHANGE/VIEW channel specific information such
as frequencies, squelch type, squelch codes, and scan lists.

Warning:  CHANGE/VIEW does NOT actually modify the radio codeplug data, but
          instead  it  modifies  a  copy of the  data  retrieved  from  the
          codeplug (or archive file) via the GET/SAVE functions.

          After  all  CHANGE/VIEW modifications  are  completed,  you  MUST
          return to the GET/SAVE menu and PROGRAM the changes back into the
          radio  or  SAVE  them  to a  new  archive  file.   Otherwise  the
          modifications will be lost when you turn off your computer.

NAME  is the number displayed on the two digit seven segment display.   The
NAME  data field allows the number displayed to be different than the  mode
number.  This,  for  example,  allows  the channels to be displayed  in  an
unusual  order such as 1,2,4,5.  Any sequence desired can be chosen.  A few
words of caution should be given:

     a.   Earlier radio software versions do NOT support this feature!
     b.   The name will have no effect on 2 channel radios.
     c.   Choose names  which  are not easily  confused  with  the  numbers
          displayed by the call list entries.
     d.   On  low  band radios there may be difficulties viewing the  noise
          blanker status.

Busy Channel Lockout                                                   4512

  Busy  Channel Lockout may be enabled by choosing "Y".  When enabled,  the
radio will be 'polite' to other users on the channel.  In other words,  the
radio will not let you hear conversations of other users and will not allow
you  to transmit on top of another user.  The only calls you will hear  are
those  with  your PL code,  even if you are off hook or press  the  monitor
button.  If  you  press PTT on the radio while there is a  carrier  on  the
channel, the radio follows this protocol:

          a. If the carrier has your PL, then you are allowed to transmit
             just like normal.
.P
          b. If the carrier has no PL or the wrong PL, then you will hear
             a  busy  tone while you hold PTT.  Release PTT and  try  again
             later.

  If you choose "N", then the radio will transmit and receive like a normal
two-way radio.

When this screen is displayed the cursor is placed on the TYPE data  field.
There are five available system types.   They are None, STAR, MDC1200, QCII
(QUIK CALL),  and DTMF. The  system types are selected by using the Up/Down
arrow keys.    None implies that all of the signalling systems in the radio
are  deactivated.    When  STAR,   MDC1200,  QCII, or DTMF is activated the
associated parameter data fields will be displayed.

ID                                                                     4703

MDC1200 :
  MDC1200 requires that each radio have a unique four digit ID number.  The
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.  The range is
  from  0001 to DEEE.   Four zeroes will show up as "NONE";  this is useful
  when you desire the radio to "listen only". An example of a "listen only"
  situation  might  be  a  volunteer fireman  monitoring  a  fire  dispatch
  channel.

STAR :
  STAR  requires that each radio have a unique four digit ID  number.   The
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.  The range is
  from  0000 to 16383.  You may enter the ID in two ways.  The first way is
  without the tag bits added to the ID.  In this case, you will type in the
  ID that you want to have appear on the dispatcher's console  first.  Then
  on the tag bit line you will set the proper combination for the customer.
  If  the channel is only being used by one customer,  then chances are the
  tags will be 0 0. The third line shows you what the ID would look like in
  a  system  which  uses  the tag bits as  an  extension  of  the  ID.  For
  reference, the first tag bit adds 8192 to the ID and the second adds 4096
  to the ID.

QCII :
  QCII ID corresponds to tones A, B, and C. It requires at least two unique
  tones.  The default is 358.6 Hz (tone A), 903.s Hz (tone B), and  0.0  Hz
  (tone C). The range is from 304.0 to 2470.0 Hz. Don't be alarmed if the
  frequency that you type in changes by a few Hertz. This change can occur
  because the program must calculate the nearest frequency that the radio
  can understand. You will find that the error will always be within the
  acceptable industry bandwidth.

DTMF :
  DTMF  requires each radio to have a unique 1 to 8 digit ID  number.   The
  default is the last four digits of the radio serial number.   Digits 0 to
  9, *, and # may be used. Any unused digits may be filled in with a '-'
  character.

.P
GROUP ID                                                               4704

  The  MDC1200 id is a three hex digit number common to a group  of  radios
and ranges from 000 to EEE.

  The DTMF id is a 1 to 8 digit id.   The digits 0 to 9,  *,  and # may  be
used.   It is IMPORTANT that the number of group digits does not exceed the
number of id digits because the radio will never decode the group ID.
.P
CALL FORMAT                                                            4705

  There are 8 different choices for this field.  The choice determines  the
sequence  in which this radio needs to see the QCII tones for an individual
or group call. The Up/Down arrow keys will scroll through the choices.  The
following is a list of those choices:

CALL FORMAT (cont)

Example:
     For  choice   A-B/A-C/LONG C,  an A-B sequence would be an "individual
call" while an A-C or LONG C would be a "group call".  Group calls normally
cannot be acknowledged.

CALL TYPE                                                              4706

  There are three different choices for this field.  The Up/Down arrow keys
will scroll through the following choices :  Call Alert,  Call Alert/Voice,
and  Voice  Selcall.   Call Alert leaves call indication at  the  receiving
radio.    Call  Alert/Voice  leaves  a  call  indication  and  unmutes  the
loudspeaker  of the receiving radio.   Voice Selcall unmutes loudspeaker on
receiving radio but does not leave any call indication.   MDC1200 does  not
allow Voice Selcall call type since Voice Selcall is an inherent feature of
all MDC1200 signalling systems.
.P
PL/DPL REQUIRED                                                        4707

  The Up/Down arrow keys will allow the choices of either "Y" or "N".   "Y"
implies the correct PL/DPL is required to recieve data.  "N" implies PL/DPL
is  not  required  to receive data.  In most systems you  may  choose  "N",
however,  when  you  share  a channel with other users who  have  the  same
signalling type then you should choose "Y". Choosing "Y" on shared channels
will ensure that you don't accidentally receive a call which is directed to
another user.

Note :  Some existing DTMF and Quik Call systems require PL stripping, and
therefore it is recommended that an "N" be chosen in these cases.
.P
ACKNOWLEDGE                                                            4708

  The Up/Down arrow keys will allow the choices of either "Y" or "N".   "Y"
implies an acknowledge transpond tone will be sent after a valid call.  "N"
implies no acknowledge will be sent after a valid call.  The radio normally
will not acknowledge "group calls".
.P
ACKNOWLEDGE TYPE                                                       4709

  The acknowledge type can be one of the four following choices :

  1.  DIGIT - One DTMF digit will be transmitted after a valid call.  Digit
              is entered on the Acknowledge Digit data field.
  2.  ID - The ID of the radio will be transmitted after a valid call.
  3.  TONE - A predetermined tone will be transmitted after a valid call.
  4.  NO - No acknowledge will be sent after a valid call.

The Up/Down arrow keys will scroll through the allowable choices.

NOTE : QCII only has choices 3 and 4.
.P
ACKNOWLEDGE DIGIT                                                      4710

  This  field  is is used in conjunction with the Acknowledge  type  field.
This is the digit that is transmitted after a valid call if the acknowledge
type is "DIGIT".  Digits 0 to 9, *, and # may be used to create a ONE digit
acknowledge digit.
.P
ACK PRETIME                                                            4711

  Systems   that  use Call Alert require that the radio  acknowledge  (ACK)
that the  Call Alert has been received.  ACK Pretime is the delay from when
the  radio  receives  a  Call Alert to when it starts  the  ACK   sequence.
The default ACK pretime is 0.5 seconds.  If a different pretime is required
for your  system move the cursor to the ACK Pretime data field and   change
the time  using  the up and down arrow keys.  The range can be from 0.2  to
2.0 seconds in 0.1 second steps.
.P
HORN/LIGHTS                                                            4712

  When a Call Alert is received,  an external output may be activated  that
can  be  used to control a vehicle's horn or lights.   Horn/Lights  may  be
selectable,  permanent,  or  not available.   If horn/lights are selectable
then  they may be defeated by the front panel Select button.   If they  are
permanent,  they cannot be defeated without an external switch in the relay
cable.  If they are not available, then they can never be activated.
.P
HORN/LIGHTS DELAY                                                      4713

  When   External   Alarm  or Horn/Lights is activated by   the   operator,
Call   Alerts   will   activate  the  external  alarm  for  six    seconds.
Horn/Lights Delay will delay the activation of the external alarm to allow
the operator time,  if  he is in the vehicle, to respond to the Call  Alert
before   the  external alarm is activated.   If the operator  does  respond
during  the  delay time  the  external alarm will not  be  activated.   The
default  time  is  10.0 seconds.    If  a different Delay Time is  required
move  the   cursor   to  the Horn/Lights  Delay data field  and  enter  the
desired  delay.   Use the up  and down arrow keys to select a delay  of  0,
5.0, 10.0 or 15.0 seconds.
.P
SIGNALLING SQUELCH                                                     4714

  This  feature can either be enabled "Y" or disabled "N" using the Up/Down
arrow  keys.   If this feature is enable "Y",  then the front panel monitor
button  can  be used to put the radio into  signalling  squelch.   If  this
feature  is  disabled "N",  then signalling squelch is not  activated.  The
default is "N".

  Signalling  Squelch is similar to Private Line.  When enabled,  the radio
will  only unmute for Call Alerts and Voice Selcalls.  Like  Private  Line,
Signalling  Squelch  can  be  disabled by pressing the  monitor  button  or
removing  the  microphone  from  the hang  up  clip.  You  will  find  that
Signalling Squelch is automatically disabled when channel scan is on.
.P
DOS HOLDOFF                                                            4715

  Data   Operated   Squelch  (DOS)  is  used with  data signalling  systems
(such  as  MDC-1200)   to    mute    the  data  transmissions   to   reduce
operator  annoyance.   DOS  attempts  to  mute  the  speaker  when data  is
present  on  the channel.    DOS Holdoff keeps  the speaker muted   for   a
preset period  of time from when carrier is  detected   by    the   squelch
circuit.    This  allows the DOS time to detect any data  activity, further
reducing the annoyance of data being heard from the speaker.

  The  default  holdoff  is 0.5 seconds.    If a different holdoff time  is
required  for   your system  move the cursor to the DOS Holdoff data  field
and  change the   time using the Up/Down arrow keys.  The range can be from
0.0   to  4.3  seconds  in  0.1 second  steps.   The  radio   automatically
defeats  DOS Holdoff while channel scan is turned on.
.P
PTT ID                                                                 4716

  If you want your unit id to be sent on each Push-to-talk (PTT),  then set
this field to "PRE", "POST", or "BOTH".  "PRE" sends the id at the press of
PTT. "POST" sends the id upon release of PTT. "BOTH" sends the id twice per
transmission,  once  at  the press and once at the release of PTT.  If  you
choose "NONE", then the id will not be sent during PTT.
.P
PTT SIDETONE                                                           4717

  PTT   sidetones   are  used when PTT ID is  activated.    Sidetones   are
heard  through the speaker when the operator first presses the  PTT.   They
are  used  to  tell  the  operator   that he cannot  speak  until  the   ID
has   been transmitted.  There are two sidetones available in the  MaxTrac.
The  PTT  ID Sidetone  is a continuous tone heard from PTT until the ID has
been  sent.  The second tone, PTT Short Sidetone, is a short beep after the
ID  has   been sent.    Both  tell  the operator when he is  permitted   to
speak  into  the microphone.   One,  both  or no Sidetones maybe activated.
They   can  be activated  by moving the cursor to the desired sidetone  and
using the Up/Down arrow keys to choose either "Y" or "N" to either activate
or deactivate the sidetones.

  The  Sidetone choice is also used when sending a call from the Call  List
and whenever a sequence is generated by pressing the 'Select' button.
It is suggested that if this signalling system is to be used by a Call List
entry that the Sidetone(s) be enabled.
.P
PTT SHORT SIDETONE                                                     4718

  PTT   sidetones   are  used when PTT ID is  activated.    Sidetones   are
heard  through the speaker when the operator first presses the  PTT.   They
are  used to  tell  the  operator  that he cannot yet speak until  the   ID
has   been transmitted.  There are two sidetones available in the  MaxTrac.
The PTT  ID Sidetone  is a continuous tone heard from PTT until the ID  has
been  sent.  The second tone, PTT Short Sidetone, is a short beep after the
ID  has   been sent.    Both  tell  the operator when he is  permitted   to
speak  into  the microphone.   One,  both  or no Sidetones maybe activated.
They   can  be activated  by moving the cursor to the desired sidetone  and
using  the  Up/Down arrow keys to choose either "Y" or "N" to  activate  or
deactivate the sidetones.

  The  Sidetone choice is also used when sending a call from the Call  List
and whenever a sequence is generated by pressing the 'Select' button.
It is suggested that if this signalling system is to be used by a Call List
entry that the Sidetone(s) be enabled.

PRETIME                                                                4719

  The    pretime    is  the  delay from the start  of  transmit  (when  the
operator pushes PTT) to when  the data signalling begins.    This delay  is
required   in  order  to  allow   the  radio    to   completely   open  the
communications  path  through   repeaters  or  other   system   components.
The  default   pretime   is 0.5 seconds.    If  a  different   pretime   is
required  for your  system move the cursor  to  the Pretime data field  and
change the  time using the Up/Down arrow keys.   The range can be from  0.1
to 4.3 seconds in 0.1 second steps.

FIXED RETRY WAIT                                                       4720

  When  emergency  is  activated  by  the  operator  the  radio  expects an
acknowledge from the base station.  If no acknowledge is received then  the
radio   will repeat the emergency sequence after a delay.  The radio always
waits a random time greater than twice the Pretime.  The additional time is
the  Fixed Retry Wait time.  Fixed Retry Wait is the time the  radio  waits
between emergency tries.  The default  is 0.0  seconds (STAR default is 8.1
seconds).   If  a  different Wait Time is required move the cursor to   the
Fixed  Retry  Wait data field and change the time using the  Up/Down  arrow
keys.   The  range  can be from 0.0 seconds to 16.9 seconds in  0.4  second
steps.

  When a PTT ID transmission is received by the radio it contains the ID of
the  transmitting  radio.   The name of the call entry associated with  the
transmitting radio ID will be displayed on the screen.  If no call entry is
associated with the transmitting radio ID, then "00" (not for DTMF) will be
displayed  on  the radio.   Use the Up/Down arrow keys to choose either  to
have the transmitting radio "name" displayed on the front  panel,  "Y",  or
not  to  have the transmitting radio "name" displayed on the  front  panel,
"N".  Since  2  channel radios do not have a display,  choosing "Y" is  not
recommended.

CONSOLE                                                                4722

  One  radio  in  the  system should be designated  as  the  Console  Radio
(Control Unit).   The purpose of this radio is to acknowledge the receiving
Emergency Alert.   If this field is enabled "Y",  the radio will respond to
an Emergency with an acknowledge transmission.   Use the Up/Down arrow keys
to  choose either "Y" or "N".  Since 2 channel radios do not have a display
to show the unit ID of the transmitting radio,  they are not recommended as
Console radios.

  After   the  DTMF  decoder  has  received  a  valid  digit  it  waits   a
predetermined  time for the next expected tone before resetting.  Resetting
causes the decoder to look for the first digit of the ID. Reset Duration is
the time period that the decoder waits before resetting.  This duration may
be  set  from 0.2 to 33.0 seconds.  The default is  2.5  seconds.  Use  the
Up/Down arrow keys to change the default value if necessary.

FILE MAINTENANCE                                                       1500

The  File Maintenance Menu is designed to help you manage your  files.   It
can  be used to restore lost Archive Files from your Back-up Files,  create
new Back-up Files, create Directory paths, delete Archive Files, and ReForm
the Archive DataBase File ('MAXTRACM.DBF') in any directory that contains
valid CodePlug files.

DataBase File MAXTRACM.DBF, in EACH Directory, is used by the RSS as a
catalog of CodePlug files that have been previously SAVED to DISK in that
Directory. It should be included in all EXTERNAL (-DOS-) BACKUP operations.
CodePlug files in each Directory have the -DOS- proto-name "Aserial.num'.
.P
CREATE DIRECTORY PATH                                                  1501

This  screen  will  create  any  desired  directory  path  by  adding  sub-
directories that can be accepted by the DOS operating system. Enter the new
directory path and press the  Enter  key.  Only  one  sub-directory may be
added at a time, under a  pre-existing  sub-directory.  An Example path;

       C:\MRSS\MAXTRAC\ARCHIVE\CUSTOMER <Enter>

This  would add sub-directory "CUSTOMER" under the existing sub-directory
"ARCHIVE".  A new Archive DataBase File 'MAXTRACM.DBF', with -no- catalog
entries, is also created within the new Directory.
.P
DELETE ARCHIVE FILE                                                    1502

The  Delete Archive File screen allows you to delete any Archive File  from
the directory displayed in the Archive Path.

Function Key Descriptions:

F3 - The CHANGE ARCHIVE function allows you to change the Archive Directory
     Path.  Enter the new Path and Press the Enter key.

F5 - The PRINT function prints the serial numbers of the archived files  to
     your printer.
.P
F7 - The  DELETE  FILE function  will delete the file associated  with  the
     highlighted  serial number.  You can move the highlight cursor to  the
     desired  serial number by using the Tab and Enter keys.  Press  F7  to
     delete  the file.  The Computer will ask you to confirm the delete  by
     pressing F7 again.  The catalog entry in MAXTRACM.DBF is also deleted.
.P
RESTORE ARCHIVE                                                        1503

This  screen  is used to restore lost Archive Files from  a  Back-up  Files
Disk.

Function Key Descriptions:

F3 - The  CHANGE SOURCE function is used to point to the Back-up  directory
     Path.  Enter the new Path and press the Enter Key.

     contained in the Source Path to the directory of the Target Path.
.P
(Re)FORM ARCHIVE DATABASE FROM CODEPLUG FILES                          1505

The (Re)Form Archive File Screen allows you to (re)form an Archive DataBase
File  ('MAXTRACM.DBF')  in any directory containing  valid  CodePlug  files
which have the proto-name 'Aserial.num'. Edit the Path Name to point to the
DIRECTORY which contains the files to be cataloged, then press 'Enter'.  Up
to  500  CodePlug files will be cataloged and made accessable.  This allows
CodePlug  files  to be  sorted / organized into several different Working
Directories, and enables recovery from corrupted / lost DataBase Files.

 !!! WARNING !!!  Any prior version of MAXTRACM.DBF in that Directory will
be overwritten by the new catalog.  If a prior MAXTRACM.DBF exists and has
valid entries, you are -STRONGLY ADVISED- to do a COMPLETE -DOS- BACKUP of
ALL files in that Directory before reforming the Archive DataBase, because
all prior catalog entries will be LOST.
.P
CALL LIST CONFIGURATION                                                4900

This screen allows you to configure a call list so that you may selectively
call  other radios.  Once this call list is complete,  you may use  the
'Select'  button  on  the front of your radio to select the  individual  or
group that you wish to call.

The  list  is built one entry at a time.  The sequence of  the  entries  is
exactly  the same as the order you would select them from the front of  the
radio. The entry sequence may be important for your customer, so it is best
to check with him/her first.

The signalling format must be chosen first, on the SIGNAL SYTEM Configure
Menu.  Up  to 99  different  entries are allowed.  To create the first
entry in  a  blank list, you will have to use the F8 key.
.P
DISPLAY NAME                                                           4901

The  name/number that will show on the radio display whenever this entry is
being selected.  This will can be any number from 1 to 99.  We suggest that
the number be large so that your customer can easily distinguish that  this
is not a channel number.
.P
SIGNALLING SYSTEM                                                      4902

This  determines  which  signalling  format and timing will  be  used  when
sending the call.
.P
REVERT MODE                                                            4903

This field determines on which channel the call will be sent. If you always
want  the call to go out on whatever channel your customer is on, then  you
want 'NONE'; do this by using the UP/DOWN keys or typing '00'.

If you always want the call to be sent on a specific channel,  then use the
UP/DOWN keys until this channel is displayed.  Remember, however, that when
the  call is complete the radio will remain on the sending channel.
.P
ACKNOWLEDGE EXPECTED                                                   4904
This  determines  whether or not the radio will expect an acknowledge  from
unit(s) being called.  If an acknowledge is expected,  the radio will:   a)
send the call up to 5 times  b) display an 'A' if the call is  acknowledged
or a '-A' if not acknowledged.

If  an acknowledge is not expected,  the radio will only send the call  one
time and will not show any type of acknowledge display.

In general,  you would like to answer 'YES'. Group calls, however, normally
should  be  'NO'.   No acknowledge is expected for DTMF or Quik Call (their
acknowledge is heard only by the user and is not decoded).

Answering  'NO' to MDC1200 individual entries is acceptable for call  alert
and voice selcall, however, to send a radio check you MUST answer 'YES'.
.P
STRIP PL                                                               4905

Answering  'YES'  to this question will cause the radio to  send  the  call
without  PL  or  DPL.  This can be useful if you want to selectively call a
group  or  unit  without disturbing everyone else  on  the  channel   (this
normally CANNOT be done on a community repeater!)
.P
ID TYPE                                                                4906

If  this field is shown,  use your UP/DOWN keys to determine if this is  an
INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, or FLEET call.

Individual  Id - It is four digits long.   The numbers 0-9 and letters  A-F
                 can  be  used.  'F'  acts as a wildcard  and  'E'  is  not
                 available for the first digit.

Group Id - Three selectable digits,  0-F.  The first digit is automatically
           inserted by the program.
.P
Fleet Id - One selectable digits, 0-F. The first digit is automatically set
           to 'E' and the third and fourth digits are set to 'F'.

All - All digits are automatically set to 'F'.
.P
ID                                                                     4907

This is the ID of the unit or group that you want to call.
.P
CALL FORMAT                                                            4908

This only applies to Quik Call.  You may choose 'TWOTONE' or 'LONGTONE'. Be
sure to type in the frequencies you want in fields FREQ 1 and FREQ 2.
.P
CAP CODE PREFIX                                                        4909

This is for future use.
.P
FREQ                                                                   4910

This is the frequency of the tone(s) to be sent in Hertz.  Don't be alarmed
if the number rounds up or down a few Hertz once it is entered.
.P
SELECTIVE CALL LIST SUMMARY                                            4911

The Call List Summary contains up to 99 Call List Entries, for both viewing
and printing.  No fields are changable here, but Entries can be edited on
the Call List Configuration screen.

Use the PAGE-UP and PAGE-DOWN keys to scroll the List, and (F5) to print
the list.
